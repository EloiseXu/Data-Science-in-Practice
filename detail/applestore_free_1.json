For one, after around level 100, there are a few challenging levels, but pretty much from then on every level was repetitive and too easy. I preferred the challenge rather than just flying through level after level, putting limits on myself or else I would beat it too fast. Another problem is the ads: I know it\u2019s how you make your money but showing an ad after literally every game is excessive. I watched some videos to open chests (because that\u2019s pretty much the only way to finish the \u201copen X chests\u201d challenges without waiting for days on end) so having more ads on top of that is annoying. Finally I have issue with the \u201cdiamond membership\u201d that you and a bunch of other games have been offering lately. $7.99 a WEEK for what, 4 masks you\u2019ll never use, 400 coins per day, and no ads, which on any other game would cost like $3.99 once? Do you really think this game offers almost 4 times as much value as, say, Netflix, which charges like $9 a month? I would pay $7.99 ONCE for these things, maybe. I bet you offer the 3-day free trial so people sign up for it and forget to cancel, too. Having finished all the levels, I can say all in all that this is a fun game that could have been better executed if more effort was put into the levels and it weren\u2019t muddled by greed.</p>|I rated this three stars because it is to easy it is hard to understand the concept of It being this easy so I feel that the screen needs to be a little tougher maybe not you are not too easy maybe like just right for kids 12+ something is for kids 12+ it should be harder for the older kids in the younger kids so saying this I feel that it should ask you for your age and then based off of the age make it just right for that age so like if you\u2019re 12 it should be hard if you\u2019re up 4 it should be easy It should be based off their age because it\u2019s just right for that age and they should be able to change your aid my a it should be based off the age because it\u2019s just right for that age and they should be able to change The age of the person gets older like I\u2019m 11 so it should be harder for me than a four-year-old and then like if you\u2019re 12 it should be harder than a five-year-old so based off whether you\u2019re 12 11 or10 whatever you should be able to change your age that way if you\u2019re four and then you turn 10 within six years then that age should be hard enough like just rain but not harder than it should but this is too easy for me being an 11-year-old so I\u2019m just saying that it should I ask for the age also parents just so you know this game has certain add to it I\u2019ve seen that are age-appropriate starting from the age 8+ year-olds so just make sure that you know that the ad can be inappropriate</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 80%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.6, 536.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#12 in Action"}, {"size": "115.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/kwalee/id497961736?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Cast your line, reach the depths and catch as many fish as you can on your way up!

When I first started playing the game, it would usually happen all the time every time I started fishing, and ended fishing. But every, single time. Yes, you heard that right. Every, single TIME! I love the game mechanics though, smooth! But I don\u2019t want the ads. The ads should show up once in a while, not all the time or sometimes. Maybe $3.99 is probably too much. You guys have to stop these advertisements. No one cares about them, and no one wants them here. I would\u2019ve give this game 5 star rating if those ads weren\u2019t around. Like the popular ratings on this app, they also say that ads are completely annoying. I usually exit the game because the ads show up, wishing never to come back in a few moments. Make the ads pop up once in a while. Also, your ratings on the game is 4.5! It has got to reach 5 stars. But not with those ads.. you have to remove them. As I said before, they should come once in a while and I was willingly wishing that the ads are annoying. Why would there be an advertisement in the game? You might get paid for adding them, but still, let the players of the game buy new products like money or something. This game is awesome though!</p>|To make a long story short, I was introduced to this game after seeing my best friend and her cousin completely addicted to it. I was a little skeptical, but I tried it out on their phone after a brief demo of how it was played. Game play is simple- simply tap the screen and the hook will descend, leaving you nothing to do but swipe your finger across the screen to catch the fish. I have been playing this for a while now, and still find myself playing it a couple times a day. Yes, like other reviews you do see a lot of ads, mostly if you want to double your money to be able to dive deeper and earn more money while offline. While they don\u2019t bother me too much, it\u2019s a small price to pay rather than shelling out real money to upgrade. However, I do have a few suggestions I\u2019d like to make to make the game a bit interesting. I\u2019d like to go deeper, perhaps even encounter a Kraken or other big sea creatures. Maybe being able to unlock other fishing poles could help attract fish that are worth more or extremely rare. Also, maybe random things like treasure chests or a mermaid spotting would entice other player</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 74%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.5, 227.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#17 in Sports"}, {"size": "292.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/fastone-games/id1402946708?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Must use brain to finish all levels.

It was the complete opposite. I mean, the puzzles are pretty fun at first but as you get further, they get way too boring. I mean, I literally almost fell asleep playing this!!! And I don\u2019t like how many ads there are &gt;:( they are so annoying!!! And whenever I get less than 3 stars on a level, there is an annoying pop-up that is like, \u201cwatch an ad to get 3 stars?\u201d Or something like that. And it said #1 time killer, but it\u2019s more like #1 time waster. I wasted a lot of my time and in the ad it had like a way better version of this game. And the beginning has nothing to do with the subject at all :(. It just had a stick an that walked onto a stage and started dancing randomly. And I think the only reason you have to complete the boring puzzles is just to get a bunch of useless coins to upgrade your dance moves and stuff, which is weird. And I don\u2019t get it why on like every single stage it always HAS to have a sleeping guy that is doing a random hobby. I already deleted the game a few minutes after I got it, because of how boring it was. Guys listen up here, do NOT waster your thing me playing this game!!!! \ud83d\ude21 (this last part is an edit) btw, the subject is VERY boring. There is one goal to complete and that is just moving around a red ball to wake up a sleeping guy -.- how stupid. I want my money back :(\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c</p>|Ok so when I first opened the app, I was confused when I saw a random stick figure dancing on a stage. Basically the whole game revolves around getting coins in which you can use to... upgrade your stage and dancer? You gain coins by either watching ads, paying money, or doing puzzles. All of the puzzles have basically one goal, get the ball to a specific object or person(usually either a star or a sleepy man). These puzzles are quite fun at first, but they just get quite repetitive and annoyingly hard to understand. They aren\u2019t satisfying to complete and don\u2019t give you enough coins. For example, paying 99 cents will get you 1,800 coins, while one challenge (which sometimes can take a few minutes if your trying to get a 3 Star) will give you 30. Also watching one ad can get you 200 coins. After every other puzzle you complete a skippable ad will pop up and an option to watch an ad for a reward will come up. After about 30 minutes of playing I just said to myself, what is the point of this  if the reward isn\u2019t even satisfying?(which it isn\u2019t) Well then I though that is was just to kill time and have fun while doing so. But there are so many apps out there that do this soooo much better, and they are actually fun to play. Don\u2019t waste your time with this app, please.</p>|I\u2019m doing this again. Sorry. I was on snap chat once and when I was done looking at my friend\u2019s stories, I saw an ad for hello stars. The add was about a guy sitting on a toilet with a girl outside the door, needing to go to the bathroom rly badly. U had to take the water balloon on one side of the weigh scaler thing and try to throw it to the guy, by making a circle on the other side of the weigher thing. And hit the guy. I saw the ad and it seemed pretty fun, so I downloaded the game. When I opened the app for hello stars, the game was TOTALLY different from the ad. there was no water balloon or anything. Just a red ball. I thought, maybe for the first few levels it\u2019s just using a red ball. I\u2019m on level 90 right now. And it still hasn\u2019t changed. THE AD DOES TO RELATE TO THE GAME. Also, this game said it was 4+. The ads I see are definitely over 13+, like in an episode add, there was this girl being pregnant and there was curse words in some of the ads, so yeah. Also, there are WAY to many ads. But I decided not to delete this game bc it\u2019s kinda addicting. #kbyenow</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 78%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 178.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#35 in Board"}, {"size": "160.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/instagram-inc/id389801255?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Instagram is a simple way to capture and share the world\u2019s moments.

There\u2019s that little green circle, showing that someone\u2019s active or was active a certain amount of time ago. All the time...when someone was active a certain amount of time ago, it won\u2019t show it until later. For example...I\u2019ve messaged someone around 12:30 P.M. one time. It didn\u2019t have the green circle, saying they were active or active a certain amount of time ago. Then, 20 minutes later (12:50), a green circle popped up on them, saying they were active 50 minutes ago (12:00, which is 30 minutes before I sent them a message). Also, another thing I\u2019m curious about is still with the green light. It won\u2019t show that they\u2019re active when they actually are active. I was just was curious about that. I\u2019m not complaining about this, at least I\u2019m not trying to. I apologize if I am. But, I was curious about it. It\u2019s been happening for a few years.

I\u2019m a singer, so lots of people want to friend me on Facebook so they can follow my posts. Now when I accept a friend request, I\u2019m bombarded with notifications to wave or say hi to my new friend. Also, Facebook is not a dating or hook up site for me. When I accept a friend, I control what they can see for a reason... I don\u2019t want to get personal with them. Now my notification icon blows up with stuff I would get on a dating site.. hey beautiful, you\u2019re so sexy, etc. I hate it!! One night I was cooking dinner for my family and my phone started going off with a weird notification ring I never heard before. My husband picked it up and it was another man calling my phone through messenger! These people don\u2019t have my phone number for a reason. I only give it out to those who need it. Now any random person can call me through the app without having my phone number. Facebook is constantly changing things so I can\u2019t keep up with this type of new feature so I was very surprised  This is a great app for cheating on your spouse, if you\u2019re into that. I don\u2019t have time to accept a friend request, then go block every one of them on messenger, especially if I just accepted a bunch of new friends. Now I have hundreds of friend request sitting in notifications all because I don\u2019t have time to follow through blocking them on messenger. Messenger is a Super invasion on my personal life... it was deleted!</p>|Look, the app does what it\u2019s supposed to do. It\u2019s a platform for contacting my FB friends and it does that just fine. Hence the two stars. However, with every single other app I own, you can opt out of notifications just once and never get asked again. I don\u2019t like unnecessary notifications clogging up my phone all day long. I don\u2019t want messenger notifications. EVERY TIME I log into the app, a pop up reminder comes up reminding me that my notifications are off and prompting me to turn them on. Even when I dismiss this alert, there\u2019s a notification (little red circle with a number one in it) next to my photo on the app that is also a reminder to turn on my notifications. The red circle never goes away. And now just this week I\u2019ve started getting an alert in red at the top of my messenger inbox letting me know that my notifications are not on. I find all of this very annoying and over the top. This issue in and of itself makes me want to delete the app. If I don\u2019t want notifications then leave me alone! Why is it so important to this app that it\u2019s forcing me to get notifications? Someone turn this off for goodness sakes.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 67%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.2, 685.2K Ratings", "category": "Social Networking", "sub_rank": "#1 in Social Networking"}, {"size": "448.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 10%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/facebook-inc/id284882218?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Keeping up with friends is faster than ever. \u2022 See what friends are up to\u2022 Share updates, photos and video\u2022 Get notified when friends like and comment on your posts\u2022 Watch and interact with live video\u2022 Play games and use your favorite apps\u2022 Buy and sell locally on Facebook MarketplaceNew!

It took me a while to figure out that the longer you hold down, the more power you have when you let off. Although, this can be a huge disadvantage if you don\u2019t aim carefully. Through figuring this out, I also noticed a bug where, if you hit another ball too hard, it will launch it outside of the map; causing you to not get a kill, and the bot is technically still alive, so you can\u2019t win at that point even if you knock the rest off. I also found out, that if you miss and launch too hard, you can fly off the map and keep falling into a never ending \u201cabyss\u201d, forcing you to close the game and re-open it(the only way I\u2019ve found to restart). Now these are fairly minor bugs if you think about it, yes it can be a little annoying but since I\u2019m at the current highest rank(Master 1) it\u2019s not a huge deal to win or lose. Which brings me to another point; I feel like leveling up each time you win is sort of too easy, since there\u2019s only 20ish ranks. Maybe add a points system for every kill and every win which will help you level, and also give you some kind of currency to buy different skins and whatnot. Regardless of the points of possible improvement to be made, I still enjoy it and will continue to play.</p>|This is a fun game that needs minor bug fixes and a bit more content that I\u2019m sure will be implemented in the near future. :)Tl;dr! ^__^I saw that my cousin played this game, and it looked pretty fun, so I decided I would try it. It\u2019s a great and fun game, but it needs some changes and upgrades. I am aware that this is a fairly new game and it may take a while to make it better! First, there should be more ranks added. I reached the highest rank (Master 1) in just half a day. Also, there should be a point system based on your kills so you don\u2019t level up every round. Next, I think there should be better and cooler skins. For example, skins with patterns and designs! Maybe these can be bought with coins that you would also get based on kills. Finally, BUGS! This game is new and obviously a bit buggy, but I honestly haven\u2019t had to deal with much. The only big bug that I\u2019ve had to deal with is how smaller players can knock you off the map, and how bigger players can knock you all the way across the map and off the other side! I bet that the people behind this great game are going to fix and update this game in the future. I know I\u2019ll wait!</p>|This review is for all those people who feels like this is the worst game ever. Yes, this game is a basic game and it\u2019s one that just came out. Any game that just starts up will always have bugs to work out and work towards adding new stuff to it. If none of you have figured this out yet, you live in a land of make believe. 99.9% of free games will have ads in them and if you don\u2019t like it, turn on airplane mode or something like that. People complain about minute long ads on here, I have been able to close out of every ad within about 5-10 seconds, with most being 5 seconds. Sorry if you can\u2019t figure that one out, life is already hard but if you can\u2019t figure something that simple out, I am very sorry. If you have an issue with the fact that when you\u2019re the same size as the other bot and you both push each other the same distance and it seems like a stalemate, try a different strategy (meaning, take a different approach at trying to knock the bot off). You\u2019re not going to win every single time. It took me about half a day to get to master 1 (highest current level), so it\u2019s not that hard.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 79%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.6, 174.2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "N/A"}, {"size": "135.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/epic-games/id387428403?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Works with: iPhone SE, 6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR; iPad Mini 4, Air 2, 2017, 2018, ProFortnite DOES NOT support: iPhone 5S, 6, 6 Plus; iPad Air, Mini 2, Mini 3, iPod Touch Fortnite has come to mobile!

It just started when you guys updated it. Sometimes when I just land on a building or even before that. The second to last  thing is that the shooting button is on top of the joy stick. And I notice that you tried to make it easier by having it be able to tap on the screen to shoot but for me it barely works. I could be tapping on my screen trying to snipe or shoot another person. So please put the shooting button to the right or in the settings put controls and have people be able to drag things where they want and have a test run with an AI. The last thing ties in with the thing I said earlier but when reloading a gun with that small little circle it could make you shoot and give away your cover and when opening a chest. I would like a button that opens the chest. For example I try to open a chest and I try again and again then I destroy the chest. One more thing is the 50v50. It was the most fun I ever had on fortnite and yes I play on Xbox one. As I was saying it was fun. The whole team got together and built a huge for and one guy from the opposite team the whole team would rain fire on him. I would really want it back for good and not limited time only. Again I wouldn\u2019t want it to crash that much.</p>|I\u2019m tired of other reviews saying it lags so much on cellular data. The game is trying to connect to 100+ people at the same time trying to get a stable connection where it runs decently. If you could somehow add a configuration for a controller that would be cool unless I didn\u2019t notice that it is already a thing. The graphics are so far good for mobile game. The reason I got the game is to go on playground or something with my friends. It also be cool if you added some sort of launcher that locks on to vehicles like the planes for example. The person flying the plane would have to spin and get lucky if it misses. The rocket would only have so much fuel though. Sort of like the old launcher but you can\u2019t fully control it. You\u2019ll have to lock on until the crosshair turns to a different color.It would be cool if you had a mode where people in planes attack the other team which are in a base with the anti aircraft and some other guns but you can\u2019t hijack a plane. The other team could have people drop in with some gun from the planes. The base would have traps all around it and they would be breakable. The planes wouldn\u2019t be able to ram into the base but they can shoot the outer walls and shoot inside. If the pilot dies then the plane would blow up. The pilots wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the plane. It could be a 50 v 50 like thing but the base is huge. Just an idea for future modes.</p>|I love this mobile game you can move around controls and is easy to play, it\u2019s also really fun and not violent at all no blood etc. but it\u2019s not the same and they added CONTROLLER SUPPORT witch is super annoying, and your thinking isn\u2019t that good, well it\u2019s not, it gives other players huge advantages and disadvantages to players without a remote plus once you get good with mobile controls and then people get controllers and you used to be better than them but now that they have a controller your way worse. Onto the actual game, the games great don\u2019t get me wrong but it could be 10x better, they took away stuff that no one and when I say no one I mean no one asked the thing to get taken away for instance double pump was the best thing ever what did they do take it away and make the gun do 7 damage every headshot, also they added way to much stuff: rifts, rift to goes, boom boxes, ports fortress\u2019s when they had port-a-forts, also p90\u2019s are a joke they are the fastest firing gun in the game next to the mini gun and do as much damage as regular AR\u2019s also no need for the heavy AK if you already have AR\u2019s and also scars, no need for infantry rifle, bring back semi auto sniper, get rid of turrets they are the most over powered and stupid item in the game. Also why bring Bach OG skins, because Epic Games is so greedy, they did it for the money no other reason. Make the game Back to how it used to be please and everyone will love it how they used to</p>", "four_star": "width: 6%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 83%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.6, 3.7M Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#1 in Adventure"}, {"size": "217.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/google-llc/id281956209?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Navigate your world faster and easier with Google Maps.

I like that it apparently integrates user movement over time; for example, when I moved to my house, it ignored a pedestrian footpath to the other half of my street, but it now no longer routes me two miles away when I\u2019m going to the bus.  The reason I don\u2019t give it five stars is its integration with Lyft/Uber, because my pocket would open the links and sometimes nearly summon a car (I had to delete them to avoid being charged), and because of transit system shortcomings.   GMaps doesn\u2019t offer enough different choices for routes, sometimes missing obvious bus lines or transfers, sometimes only giving one option it thinks best, though I might know more info and want to prompt more choices, which isn\u2019t possible.  I a forced to enter fake destination or origin information to force other routes to display.  One bus may be very crowded at certain times, one route may have a steep hill.  It needs to offer a way to expand route choices.  Also, I still need to use OneBusAway to check on arrival times, as GMaps is not always current, especially with detours and alterations.  As for driving, it\u2019s fine, except the way it ignores neighborhood shortcuts and alternatives. Overall, a good tool to assist you, but you need your own knowledge to make it truly effective. Therefore, 3.5 stars, which I weighted up to 4.</p>|Google Maps took over ALL the space in the market to substitute MapQuest and all those bulky GARMIN GPS devices that you had to pay to update the maps and was very complicated to do so, even if you wanted to pay for them. Google Maps also \u2018killed\u2019 all those country specific maps that you had to buy every year you went out to Europe. Google Maps scored the biggest accomplishment to defeat Apple Maps in their own home device natural platform, no Apple iPhone lover will use the Apple Maps, they preferred to download the Google Maps App and move Apple Maps to some far far away screen where no one could see it. Then Wase came around with a different approach, the community sharing navegador, but still Google Maps was the KING of the map applications domain. And now, the very self Google Developers and Marketers are \u201cdestroying with their feet, what they made with their hands\u201d... by converting the former wonderful best in the world and in its class navigation app into a silly shopping mall on the road, taking 1/3 of the screen to show the navigator all this distractions that defeat the purpose of using the app to get to our destination fast, faster. Yeah! They should change the icon for a new one with a \u2018restaurant\u2019 feeling. On top of that, I would like to know the statistics that supported the decision to add the \u2018car pooling\u2019 option, really?How about returning to us, the users, our beloved original easy to use \u201cGoogle Maps\u201d.Thank You..!</p>|I have been using google maps since 2011. I never write reviews but this app has surpassed my expectations. I have tried waze, ios maps and they dont do it for me. I am a truck driver by trade and aside from truck route maps on a desktop, i always use google maps. Will google maps ever be perfect? No but we are talking about perfect cellphone service and non hesitant location tracking to have a perfect gps. Depending where you are and who your carrier is, your cell reception might be shakily and you might miss a turn, not the app\u2019s fault. Once google introduced the option for additional stops with in your route, they locked in my loyalty to the app. The reason why i wrote this review today is a new option that i have long awaited. Since i drive for miles, i am always on the app. I also am always listening to music. Of course i have had many times where i missed that very important turn because i was skipping or searching for a new song. Not anymore, maps now has a very simple tab on the map that lets me skip my song with my maps still on the screen. Thats a game changer for me. Once again, google has made me a pleased customer.

I also love that I can watch movies everywhere. However there are two \"updates\" that I feel actually set this app back. First I really hate that I can't rate movies and shows I watch by star ratings, unless I log in on an old device that doesn't have updates, or a computer. If I just watched it on my device or smart TV, I want to be able to rate it there. Unfortunately now the rating is only a thumbs up or down. I don't like how limited that is. I might like a movie, but not love it, or not really want to see it again for a while, however with the thumbs up, unless I remember everything about the movie I won't know how much I liked it. So now I feel unless I love a movie I have to give it a thumbs down. So personally I give a huge thumbs down to this new way of rating. I think it is definitely a downgrade. Second I wish on the new updates it would say if a show or movie is being taken off. For example I was watching one of my shows on my old Wii (which hasn't updated the software in a really long time), and on my Wii it told me that my show was only going to be available until October 9th. However when I turned the same show on my smart TV, and IPhone it didn't say anything. It would just be nice to see if the movie or show you're watching is going to be removed within the next month or so.</p>|I love Netflix BUT they stop one of my shows and it was a cliffhanger and it was mad in 2015 you think by now you you would put on the 3 season but no come on I Watch it over and over hoping you would put it on Netflix please Netflix i love the show please bring it back I watch it every day till it stopped I hope this will make you bring the 3 season if you don\u2019t well I probably will not go on Netflix because it is  a wast of my time and what would I do sit on Netflix not satisfied wow Netflix that is low even for you so please please read this if you do thank you so much I will tell you the name of the show do you want to make me happy and i will leave a bad review so please please please I am begging you to it will make me happy I put 5 \u2b50\ufe0f so Netflix please please put the 3 season of some assembly required I love that show I am making this so long for you you please I will write reviews that are really good if you put it on there I am a little girl and I love this show and it makes me laugh it mite not be so popular but please you care don\u2019t you once again it is called \u2b50\ufe0f some assembly required \u2b50\ufe0f please it is hard to explain but I love that show and I was really sad when it stopped if I were you I would make the little girl happy ps me</p>|I\u2019m a huge entertainment buff whether it be games or movies. It\u2019s just how I pass my free time when I\u2019m not working. Netflix provides a endless amount movie I wouldn\u2019t usually find on other other apps but if that was all it would be maybe \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f to me because that\u2019s nothing special. What makes Netflix a \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f you ask? Why is Netflix The Goat? To put it simply they never stop trying to entertain you, raising the bar through originals that other platforms would only wish to be tall enough to reach. Just going to give you one of many creative concepts Netflix has recently added that inspired me to write this. It\u2019s Called \u201cBlack Mirror- Bandersnatch\u201d. A movie based of their \u201coriginal\u201d hit series. This movie is a psychological thriller that on its own would be another hit putting another notch on the already crowded belt of this Powerhouse. This is the kicker though, you interact with this movie. Thats right, combining the movie experience with a video gaming feel! Oh and the movie has a gamer theme to it adding to the anxiety and pressure to make the right choices. I\u2019m not going to ruin this for you but I really hope you experience this where you don\u2019t just press play you\u2019re playing. Netflix, shaking the pillars.

And those videos actually worked I've actually purchased 4 of the advertised products! While other games 30 second commercial videos make me promise to never buy those products! (I can forgive a few 30 second videos in this game but with the latest update there are more and they are annoying.) But with this latest update and not having the opportunity to easily get as many free diamonds the game is just aggravating because it doesn't work right so I'm going to have to quit it. The free diamonds for watching videos tab actually disappears when you tap on it and the free diamonds under the + up the right-hand corner does not work at all, and the x 10 diamonds when you open up the game does not work most of the time anymore. So rather than be annoyed I'll just quit it at level 1233. You were fun but then you just became tedious. Farewell!</p>|I hate how this app makes you swipe from letter to letter when creating words because a lot of times, it doesn\u2019t recognize the swipe, making you get the word wrong and having to redo it more carefully. A lot of times you have to press down really hard to make it comprehend what you\u2019re swiping. I also highly dislike how you can get bonus words in each round, but sometimes the game doesn\u2019t recognize a real word as a bonus word. For example, you can have a group of three-letter words, and you may go through several three-letter bonus words before you figure out which one actually fits their blocks. I\u2019m working on one of the puzzles right now that has several three-letter words, but when I tried \u201celf\u201d it wouldn\u2019t take it as part of the puzzle nor a bonus word. And I swear this game makes up some words! I also don\u2019t like how you can\u2019t select which box you\u2019d like the hint to go in; it just goes in order from beginning to end. I didn\u2019t realize how much I hated this app until sitting down to write this, but the fact I felt compelled to write a review in the first place should\u2019ve told me something.</p>|It\u2019s ok... but there are several gaping holes in the game. The worst of these being, the developers of this game obviously don\u2019t have a very good grasp on the English language. There are way too many words they don\u2019t recognize that are widely accepted and common words. Another being they actually use words that aren\u2019t proper \u201cScrabble\u201d-type words, such as country and personal names. One such puzzle had Jamaica as the largest word to discover, and yet didn\u2019t accept the word jam, when there was three letter words to be found. I understand not having the word as one of the main words of the puzzle, but when you are supposed to be able to collect \u201cextra words\u201d for diamonds it\u2019s frustrating when perfectly good words aren\u2019t accepted. Its ok for wasting time as I said, but with so many games, exactly like it, with a much better dictionary of words, I don\u2019t see the point. Before the devs send me the same response to this review as has been sent before, stating that I can contact support at such and such a site with uncollected words, don\u2019t bother. It\u2019s just easier to download a game with the words already in its system with the exact same gameplay.</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 75%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 266K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#34 in Word"}, {"size": "211.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/google-llc/id281956209?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The official Gmail app brings the best of Gmail to your iPhone or iPad with real-time notifications, multiple account support and search that works across all your mail.With the Gmail app, you can:\u2022 Undo Send, to prevent embarrassing mistakes\u2022 Switch between multiple accounts\u2022 Get notified of new mail fast, with notification center, badge and lock screen options\u2022 Search your mail faster with instant results, predictions as you type &amp; spelling suggestions\u2022 Swipe to archive/delete, to quickly clear out your inbox\u2022 Read your mail with threaded conversations\u2022 Auto-complete contact names as you type from your Google contacts or your phone\u2022 Respond to Google Calendar invites right from the app\u2022 Organize your mail by archiving, labeling, starring, deleting and reporting spam\u2022 Send and receive attachments\u2022 See profile pictures as part of the conversation</p>", "subtitle": "Secure, fast & organized email", "title": "Gmail - Email by Google", "similar": "  HotspotShield VPN & Wifi Proxy\n,  Yahoo Mail - Stay Organized\n,  X-VPN Unlimited VPN Proxy\n,  Password Secure Manager App\n,  Grammarly Keyboard\n,  \u30fbMEGA\u30fb\n", "two_star": "width: 3%;", "price": "Free", "inapp_purchase": "N,/,A", "autor": "Google LLC", "reviews": "|I swiped on an email heading and the email disappeared. It never told me what it was doing with the email. Did it delete it? Did it archive it? Did it forward it to my grandma? I had no idea. So I looked for the undo button. Oh, there ISN'T one. I shook the phone, which works in EVERY OTHER APP, it's a basic iPhone function. Nope. That didn't work either. I found the email still there under \"All Mail\" but there was no way to undo the archive and put it back into my primary folder, at least no way that was immediately intuitive. So that was super frustrating. Also, there is no \"mark unread from here\" in an email conversation. So if I mark something as unread, the entire email chain gets marked as unread. This is ridiculous. I sometimes have conversations with clients that have 50 emails back and forth. I don't want to have to go through them all again. Unfortunately, the built-in iPhone mail app does the same thing. But at least it has an undo function. I have gotten to where I rarely check email on my phone because there isn't yet a good app to deal with it. It used to be simple and it used to work. Now with all the folders and functions, replacing basic functionality, it just makes it a pain. Companies always try to fix things that aren't broken and just break them in the process. So this app is deleted. And I will go back to using the iPhone mail app to scan the previews and go to my Mac to actually reply.</p>|I have been using email for quite some time now and I have found Gmail to be far superior than any other email service I have used in the past. The ability to ORGANIZE important emails with labels and stay on top of my inbox and archives gives me a personal edge. For professional documentation of conversations with Government Officials and other Professional Organizations, I have been able to quickly retrieve important conversations that have supported my position and even helped me win disputes. Speaking of \u201csearch ability\u201d, there have been occasions where I may have forgotten an individual\u2019s EXACT name or exact email address, but knew I had it somewhere; all I had to do was put an \u201c@\u201c symbol in the search box and a \u201cportion\u201d of the organization\u2019s name or something else in the search criteria and the correct email address or variations thereof \u201csurfaces from the ETHER\u201d which makes life so much easier being able to find ALL CONVERSATIONS associated with that email address! I can then properly label or categorized all correspondences with that email address for future reference. KEEP THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX WITH YOUR IMPROVEMENTS AND UPGRADES, IT IS WORKING!!!</p>|I use my iPad for work, as I need to take high resolution videos and have quick access to apps. The Gmail app has such terribly limited usability in key areas. First, it is crazy that I cannot create bulleted or numbered lists. This seems like a key component to writing succinct emails and I am not sure why this is not included. Second, I cannot copy and paste tables from other Google apps and keep the formatting! We send programs to clients that we create in Google sheets, but we do not need to send the entire sheet at one time, only a part. You simply cannot do this without creating an entirely new sheet, and then sharing it with them, which is simply not functional. I would rather be able to copy and paste the section of the sheet that is necessary to use. Lastly, the emails I send from my iPad do not have the same formatting as the desktop site. Again, I am at a loss as to why this is the case. We have a specific signature that we need to use in order to send protected information, and I have to set this signature up again instead of it carrying over from my desktop accessibility. The only good thing about this app is that I can access my email from it. However, it severely limits my ability to send useful emails and this kills my productivity during work hours with my iPad.</p>", "four_star": "width: 15%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 71%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.4, 117.8K Ratings", "category": "Productivity", "sub_rank": "#1 in Productivity"}, {"size": "62.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/lion-studios/id1362220666?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The highly anticipated follow-up to the award winning physics game Super Sharp (Editors\u2019 Choice, Best of 2015) is now available!Cut with skill to complete the 320 ingenious handmade levels of Ultra Sharp and become a cut master!Your finger has never been so sharp!</p>", "subtitle": "Cut Everything!", "title": "Ultra Sharp", "similar": "  Spinner.io\n,  Looper!\n,  Go Fish!\n,  PLANK!\n,  Run Around \uc6c3\n,  Balls Control\n", "two_star": "width: 2%;", "price": "Free", "inapp_purchase": "$0.99,$0.99,$2.99", "autor": "Lion Studios", "reviews": "|It\u2019s very fun and I enjoy the levels, but there are a few issues. As of now, it\u2019s hard to do precise cuts because you can\u2019t adjust where your first touch is, and there is a simple fix. Update it and add two finger touch slicing, it would make it so much better. The difficulty is a bit weird, like they will often have harder levels, and then throw in an easy one, I don\u2019t know if this done intentionally or not.      There are also some levels that at least in my experience is down to fine detail. Which wouldn\u2019t be a problem, except like I said it\u2019s hard to be precise.     Then there is the problem of the adds, but there\u2019s a fix that works for most games. Instead of putting your phone on airplane mode and not being able to text, call, or be texted or called, you can turn off your wifi and wait for it to give you an add. Then, go into your settings and scroll down to the game click on it and turn off data usage. Now you can resume your game without wifi and no adds. I\u2019ve also heard you can turn airplane mode on launch the app and then turn airplane mode off but i haven\u2019t tested that.</p>|The accuracy needed to do precision cuts is lacking. Overall, a fun game but the number and frequency of ads increase to the point you either have them removed or delete the game. If enjoying a game I\u2019m prone to pay to have the ads removed though that still leaves you at the publishers mercy as to how many  \u201cgame ads\u201d they roll into the developers portfolio as these are not considered ads. The logic of this escapes me which leaves only greed as the motivation. Therein lies the problem with the price being set at $4.99.  Since the shift from purchase to \u201cfree\u201d games, the cost for entertainment has skyrocketed but $4.99 just to remove ads is high in comparison to other games offering the same.  I\u2019ll delete this game as it is neither unique nor enjoyable enough to justify the price. Also, since I\u2019m already paying with the more expensive commodity of time spent viewing ads (money you can make. Time not so available.) to play I\u2019m disgusted being forced to pay an addition monetary amount that is overly inflated. We consumers are be herded into acceptance. This trend needs to be stopped at some point. This is game and price is my limit.</p>|I downloaded Ultra Sharp a few months ago, I never played it until now.

So far I\u2019m at level 40, the game is so addictive I can\u2019t stop playing! It\u2019s challenging without being impossible and once you pass a few levels you want to keep going, once I got to level 20 I noticed a change. Instead of the levels getting harder or staying at the same level they started to get easier, 2 levels didn\u2019t even have \u2018death spots\u2019 this was kind of confusing and made me think about deleting the game. When I went through a few levels I realized this stopped happening and didn\u2019t delete it, but th levels did stop getting harder. If you changed this I would give the game 5 stars. Over all this game is really fun and is great if you\u2019re looking for a simple game to help you pass time, I do have one request though, could you have a home \u2018button\u2019 or screen to take a break and look through ball and splash options? I know you can do this on the first ring in the game but it\u2019s hard to control and sometimes I end up playing instead of browsing (does that make sense?) another thing is the adds they aren\u2019t very annoying and are often short or you can exit back to the game but there are quit a few of them, the game is still great and the adds don\u2019t get in the way of playing but I thought it would be nice to warn review readers. This is such a great game and I love playing, I 100% recommended it and hope you have fun playing!</p>|I have had Helix Jump for a while now, and I absolutely love it. I play it basically whenever I can. The game is great, but there are a couple things that aren\u2019t so awesome about it.First things first: ads. Yeah, I get that ads are a way to make money for the game, but they are used way too much. They pop up just about every time you die or pass a level, which is super annoying. And when you start a level? There\u2019s one that pops up on the side and on the bottom. I just want to play my game, not have to continually x-out of ads and the App Store. Although, in the big picture, ads aren\u2019t that big a deal. One thing that is definitely a bigger problem is this: after I watch an ad for a second chance, the game drops me a few rings down, usually onto a \u2018red zone\u2019 so I die and lose whatever score I had, and I can\u2019t even watch another ad to try again. The app should at least give you a 3 second countdown so you don\u2019t die right off. A final problem is that I can\u2019t get the final helix. It\u2019s not that big a deal, but I want to know what it is. It says \u2018Unlock 5 skins\u2019 to get but I have all the other ones and it still says 0/5. I\u2019ve noticed some other reviews that mention the same thing, so it\u2019s obviously been a problem for a while. Please fix it!Other than those few issues, Helix Jump is a great game. If they were fixed, I would definitely give this five stars.</p>|So what I love to do is try to get as many boosts as possible. Who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s already a really fun and very addicting game, and the boosts make it much more exciting, but here\u2019s the problem: I bounced before I hit the boost, which gives the player a little extra time to survey the next helixes. I noticed another boost before the next set of helixes so I took it. Then came another boost. And another one. And another one. After five boosts, I was soaring to the bottom of the tower........... and then the game glitched. Rather than there being a landing platform at the bottom of the tower, there was nothing there, and I just kept falling and falling and falling. This didn\u2019t affect me that much because I wasn\u2019t trying to break any personal records, but this could largely affect players who are trying to break theirs. My guess is that because the game saw so many boosts being hit, it ended up accidentally destroying the landing platform.If you guys could fix this that would be great! Thank you.I\u2019m not done yet, though.This has been in the game probably since it was released: many (or all\u2014I don\u2019t know) people can\u2019t get the last ball (unlock 5 skins). I\u2019ve unlocked every skin except for this one but I can never get it. It would be great if you could fix this so I, and many others, could get the last skin.

Huh? Right! So after I finished level 999, IT TOOK ME RIGHT BACK!!! THERES NO LEVEL 1000!!! WHAT? Crazy huh? Made me soooo sad and kinda annoyed! I mean, the levels are decently easy after you play, so did voodoo really think people couldn\u2019t get to level 1,000 or something? Idk! But 2nd problem..... theres just too many ads! Like there isn\u2019t so many that you honestly can\u2019t play, but it\u2019s a little too much for me! And clearly some others...\ud83d\ude02 But yes, plz fix these problems! ESPECIALLY THE 1ST ONE! Cause think about it, if you can\u2019t get to the next level and it makes you play the same one OVER AND OVER! Would you really want to play the game anymore? No! Exactly!\ud83d\ude02 So you\u2019ll have no choice but to just delete the game! And after all that hard work too!\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc So yes, please get these problems fixed! Thanks for reading if you did! \u2665\ufe0f</p>|Edit same day: so I've paid for add free, but adds keep popping up and after it does the continue glitch and I have to watch an ad AGAIN, it does away after that level and remembers that I've purchased no ads. I want you to fix it. If I paid for something it should work.Old:As the other reviewers had said the adds were insane but I liked the game for it simply wasting time and to occupy myself / my nieces and nephews. I did however pay for the add free and I like it a heck of a lot more. If you get it just restart the app after or else the adds will continue so long as you are in that session. I was angry and was going to come here and write a bad report but I accidently opened it back up and no more adds! So every time I died I didn't have to wait to restart and continue. And the continue button did dissapear, but you just tap the screen again to start up as if it were there. It needs improvement but it's simply a game. I hope the payment helps in its development and allows for them to create something for the diamonds lol. Until then I'll just keep collecting them in hopes they will turn into something.</p>|So I\u2019d say that this app is really fun, but there are some problems. First, there are many adds. Oddly it seems that some days it\u2019s better than others \ud83e\udd14. Second the levels are a bit funky. Personally I struggled a lot on some levels. The way that they order the levels is very odd. I believe I got stuck one one level for about 3 days and I would be so mad that I couldn\u2019t pass this one level. I t made me want to delete the app and break items around me. Eventually I had my friend pass the level for me. The odd thing though was that the 15 levels after that were super easy and I passed them on my first try. The last thing that I would ask for the creators to fix is limited levels. I have ben very \u201caddicted\u201d to this game, so I passed many levels. I was so excited when I got to level 999, because I really wanted to get to 1,000. However, THERE ISN\u2019T A LEVEL 1,000!! So right now the app is just taking up space on my phone and since you can\u2019t go backwards to previous levels there is nothing to do on the app.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 222.4K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#16 in Family"}, {"size": "155.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 8%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bitstrips/id694701217?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Bitmoji is your own personal emoji.\u2022 Create an expressive cartoon avatar\u2022 Choose from a huge library of stickers \u2013 all featuring YOU\u2022 Use Bitmoji in Snapchat, iMessage and wherever else you chatUsing Bitmoji in Snapchat unlocks friendmoji \u2013 2-person bitmojis featuring you and your friends!</p>", "subtitle": "Your personal emoji", "title": "Bitmoji", "similar": "  myAT&T\n,  T-Mobile\n,  Amazon Fire TV\n,  FancyKey - Keyboard Themes\n,  Your Avatar Creator | Zmoji\n,  Sticker Maker Studio\n", "two_star": "width: 4%;", "price": "Infrequent/Mild Horror/Fear Themes", "inapp_purchase": "N,/,A", "autor": "Bitstrips", "reviews": "|I had bitmoji for a while a couple years ago and deleted it. No one was really using it and it got boring for me. I decided to redownload the app when my friends on snapchat began using it. I find a lot of them to be hilarious, so I\u2019ve had fun incorporating them into my everyday phone conversations.That said, I have two issues with the app. One minor issue - why isn\u2019t there a search function in the app to find bitmojis? Scrolling through them is nice just to see what\u2019s randomly there, but when I\u2019m texting and looking for something specific, it\u2019d be nice to have the option to narrow it down more quickly. Which brings me to my second, bigger issue.Someone reading this might say - you can do that with the keyboard... why aren\u2019t you using that? Well, when I went to integrate bitmoji with my text app, a notification popped up saying something along the lines of I would be giving permission for the app to access my texts, even past texts. That really bothered me. Why would the app need access to my past text messages? Like what purpose does that serve? So I declined, and I copy bitmojis straight from the app instead. Lengthier process, sure, but I really only use them with one person anyway.So I\u2019d like an in-app search feature if possible. :)</p>|Dear everyone,I would like to say that I love this game! But there are always improvements that can be done. For example: maybe some more hairstyles (I know after the update they put new ones but like more for people with short hair, cause no hair matches mine), more lip styles (I\u2019m sure everyone can agree on this one), piercings! I have ear piercings but I always wanted a nose one and lastly FASHION!!!!!! I always had this idea of that you can create your OWN outfits so, you go in the game go to the clothes and create it! So like...you want a croptop BAM you got it, want it white with some designs? BAM you got it! Want some high waisted short? BAM you already know...YOU GOT IT! Want some nikies ... YOU GOT IT!!! And then of course just decorate your outfit, maybe a necklace and some bracelets! And then..yea, you\u2019re done! Now I wanna say something first before I finish this review, I in no way am trying to take over this game these are just some ideas I got and thought maybe I should share them. Everyone can help! So don\u2019t hate because *you think* I\u2019m trying to take over the game. They made it, it\u2019s there\u2019s. Love you all, stay kind \u2665\ufe0f-XOXO \ud83d\ude42</p>|Bitmoji is an amazing app! Weather you use it for SnapChat,Texting, whatever! I enjoy how you can customize your own little you. But there is so many ways that you could make bitmoji an even more amazing app! First off more fashion! There is already lots of clothes to choose from, but try to put even more in the app more frequently and that would be fantastic! Second, you should be able to customize even more, like your height, the length of your hairstyle, and have more options for breast sizes. Thirdly, you should be able to change the color of clothing. When I go to pick a different clothing item I want and it\u2019s bright pink or some color that I don\u2019t want I no longer want to wear that item, there should be an option to change the color of the clothing item. Finally, please consider being able to mix and match items, like have and an option to \u2018mix clothing\u2019 and select the items you want to mix. Please take this into consideration it and I would give it 5 stars, it would also make the app so much more amazing! But overall I totally recommend this app over any other, it is amazing!\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f</p>", "four_star": "width: 19%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 60%;", "one_star": "width: 8%;", "star": "4.2, 68.1K Ratings", "category": "Utilities", "sub_rank": "#1 in Utilities"}, {"size": "333.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/voodoo/id714804730?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The most addictive game!Enter the arena and face the other holes in a fierce battle.

So my first idea is one that I\u2019ve already seen people suggest before and it\u2019s that there should be more than place to play at, maybe do a farm or another planet or different cities/towns from different countries, maybe even do one that\u2019s an amusement park. There\u2019s tons of different maps you could make. My other suggestion is that there be a \u2018free play\u2019 added where there\u2019s no time limit and you play by yourself until you\u2019ve eaten the whole town because personally I really just like the satisfaction of eating everything and I think it would be fun to have that as an option. I also think that another good idea would be adding power ups during the game while you\u2019re playing; I\u2019d say you could either do the power ups randomly during the game or you could have them as an option to purchase with artificial money before you play a game. The \u2018money\u2019 to purchase these power ups could come from the \u2018kills\u2019 you make in each game. And as you \u2018kill\u2019 more they add up and turn into credits after each game to where eventually you could use them to buy different power ups. Okay that\u2019s all I have for now and I really hope to see some of these come into play!</p>|First off I would just like to say that this is probably one of the worst designed apps that I have ever downloaded. It\u2019s glitchy, annoying, riddled with bugs, and honestly just doesn\u2019t have a very user friendly interface. Fist off let me just say that the speeds of the different sized holes are ridiculous. How is it that a hole 18 times bigger than me can move so much faster? And another thing, the people who get big in the beginning (I\u2019m talking about the battle royal type mode) basically win the game. It is really hard for someone to get big in the beginning and the people who can EASILY win the game over all of the smaller pictures. It\u2019s stupid that there Games last about 2 minuets and they have the audacity to make you watch an ad after every game. Now I know about the no ads purchase but honestly it\u2019s not worth it for a game that I only play when I have nothing better to do. On top of this there are huge graphical glitches, things like buildings flying across to the other side of the map, and objects sinking below to physical map. On top of all this it really doesn\u2019t seem to it would be too hard for them to fix this (but I\u2019m not a developer so I don\u2019t know) and this game could easily be one of the most fun free time games In the App Store if they fixed these. The reason that I\u2019m giving this a four star review is because if you can look past all of these problems then it is really fun.</p>|The concept of this game is really amazing. It\u2019s a fun mechanic and you really have to eat used to the physics, it\u2019s challenging to eat things when small but just as challenging when you ran a group of buildings and they all get stuck trying to go down. I notice some choppy lag when you\u2019re getting bigger, hopefully some polishing can be done to make that a little better. My major complaint is the game modes, and I can\u2019t understand how the devs went wrong on this. You have a 2 minute top score mode against a bunch of computer players which is somewhat interesting but tires quickly. Next, you have a battle mode with no time limit, but the bots will zero in on you when they know they\u2019re bigger than you so it feels unfair and rushed. Outside of local multiplayer, you have a solo mode that makes the game, no bots to deal with and no goals besides eating everything...  but again you have only two minutes. It can take a quarter of that time just to find things to get bigger when you\u2019re small, and by the time you\u2019re just big enough to have fun you\u2019re out of time. Why do this??? This type of mode needs more time, but honestly a solo mode with no time limit at all would be an absolute game-changer, pitting all these restrictions on the fun hollows the experience and leaves you frustrated and wanting more. I would love to increase the rating if the devs would allow us to enjoy the game the way we should be able to, it just doesn\u2019t make sense not to.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 79%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.6, 939.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#1 in Sports"}, {"size": "143.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/kwalee/id497961736?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Take a trip through Looper - a joyous, melodious casual game that puts your sense of rhythm and timing to the test.Every tap starts a colourful new beat that travels along increasingly complex constellations - get your timing wrong and the beats could crash and burn.

I usually don\u2019t find games like that but this one looked like a lot of good fun. And it is! It\u2019s relaxing and fun to just mindlessly play. The only problem is, the amount of ads there are. I see that there are tons of complaints about this already but maybe one more will push them further to change. I\u2019m completely okay with having ads, I didn\u2019t pay for the game, why shouldn\u2019t I have ads?   But they take it to a new level. The levels are designed to only take seconds to complete (or fail until you get it). When you finish one you\u2019re very ready for the next! But what do you get? An add that is longer than your gameplay. They should at LEAST be a minute apart! But when you solve a puzzle in 10 seconds then get an ad for 30 seconds, it\u2019s really aggravating. I hope they realize that even though they\u2019re getting money for the ads, less and less people are going to play it for very long and then they won\u2019t have money for the long run. It\u2019s just sad because it IS a great game. But unless you love to watch ads, wait until they fix it.</p>|It\u2019s a fun game, but they have gone way overboard with the ads. A 30 second ad for winning or losing a level gets annoying. That would be like a Mario game where losing a life makes you watch an ad. I get it, developers need money, and ads are a good way to do it when implemented properly. However, that hasn\u2019t been the case, as most of the other reviews say. Personally, I\u2019m at level 58, but the ads have gone insane at this point. It wasn\u2019t bad at the first few levels, but then the amount exponentially increased. It\u2019s also pointless that I have to watch an ad just to be able to change skins (what the game refers to as beats), which is basically 1 step down from paying for a cosmetic change. I am well aware that I can turn off WiFi, however, I still see ads even if I do so. Even if it worked, I don\u2019t see why that should be accepted as a solution. There is an option to pay to not have to watch \u201cnon optional\u201d ads (ads that don\u2019t appear from things like -1 beat or the solution), but that\u2019s still giving them money. At this point, how about their next update does nothing except run a cryptocurrency miner in the background? That wouldn\u2019t surprise me.</p>|When I saw this game pop up as an ad on another game I was like \u201cOh, that looks cool.\u201d So I downloaded the app, and Immediately found a problem. The game is great, I love how it uses beats, they add more creativity to the game. BUT after every single level or every single time you fail (which is a lot, the game is quite challenging, but addictive) you get an ad! And to make it worse, they are 30+ seconds long and you can\u2019t skip them. An ad after every 10 or so levels is fine, but not EVERY TIME you fail or pass a level. That is just ridiculous. I get that you have to have ads in order for an app to make money, but that many ads, and the fact that we see the same 3 over and over again, just makes you really not want to buy the game the ad is advertising.I really like this game, but it\u2019s practically impossible to play with all the ads. They are driving me crazy, and the game isn\u2019t fun anymore. If you fix this problem I will be glad to re-download the app, but for now I\u2019m just going to have to delete it. Please take my, and everyone else\u2019s words who wrote about this problem into consideration. This game could be much better without all the ads.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 81%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 162.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#4 in Music"}, {"size": "145.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 12%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/amzn-mobile-llc/id297606954?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "International Shopping Browse, search, get product details, read reviews, and purchase millions of products with Amazon International Shopping \u2013 now available in English, Spanish, German, and Simplified Chinese.

I also wish for Uber to participate in the para transit or special transportation service also known as STS in Miami Dade County Florida. I know that there are other cities such as Boston Massachusetts and Alta Monte Springs in Florida which allow Uber in all the ridesharing services to participate and supplement the para transit or special transportation program. This would give us people with low vision blind or with any disability the opportunity to have transportation on demand and not have to call in advance 24 hours and at the same time have to wait for other people to travel and to be dropped off</p>|Complaints always seem to be first on the mind when rating. So before launching that, I will say that the quality of service is higher than all others in the same class of rider apps and service. However, the change to anonymous calls to drivers and anonymous texts is highly questionable since its the only option. And who could blame them for not answering. It\u2019s not like one is likely to be calling to chat about the weather. Rather the normal scenario is that the time to arrival just doubled, car is headed in the opposite direction than the app indicates and you are already 15 minutes late for your appointment because the past  two drivers cancelled the ride after you waited 8-10 minutes. And Uber has no customer service in real time- so at best you can report whatever and a couple of days later you will receive a well groomed response but in real time you are on your own. Transportation in NYC has been revolutionized by rider apps. And some are actually cheaper than the old stalwart, a yellow cab. But that\u2019s not our Uber which is at the top range on average but doesn\u2019t spike to ridiculous 4-5x normal price during special periods quite as egregiously as one of its competitors. So if you are new to the city, take the tips and if you are Uber, do better since you are absolutely being paid to do and if not, another will fill the gap. That\u2019s what rider apps have in their future according to my hopeful prediction.</p>", "four_star": "width: 7%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 85%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.7, 849K Ratings", "category": "Travel", "sub_rank": "#1 in Travel"}, {"size": "153.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/pandora-media-inc/id284035180?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Pandora gives you a personalized listening experience that continually evolves with your tastes.Create stations from your favorite songs, artists or genres, search or  browse to find recommended stations for your mood or activity, and discover podcasts that speak to you.

They are a little narrow in their offerings from any individual band.  For example, if choose a \u201cstation\u201d called Supertramp I heat Supertramp\u2019s greatest hits over and over again, which is fine, but if I choose a station based on a specific band, it is safe to assume I like more than just their most popular songs.  I should hear their entire catalog.  If I choose a genre-based station it is okay to play just hits from various bands in that genre, but if I pick a specific band, Pandora should be smart enough to realize I want everything from that band, not just their hit songs.I also have a frequent connectivity issue.  I live in a rural area where it is not uncommon to lose cellular coverage and subsequently my Pandora feed.  No problem, I understand this is unavoidable.  The problem is that when I regain cellular connectivity Pandora often will not reboot. About half the time I have to turn my phone completely off to get Pandora to restart.  This is not safe when I am driving so I either have to pull over or live without Pandora until I get to my destination.  I have an iPhone 6s with Apple CarPlay in my vehicle.I love Pandora except for these two issues.  Thanks,Mike Kingsley</p>|I listen to Ryan Farish radio on Pandora Plus everyday. So relaxing. It has become an addiction. I connect it to my car audio via Bluetooth on the iPhone app and play it on Roku TV while reading, surfing the net and relaxing. I listen to Pandora more than I watch TV. It has a great selection of new age/trance instrumental artists like Ryan Farish (of course), 7 and 5, and Deosil. It throws in some classical, soft jazz, and EDM for variety. Even my bunny likes it! I tried Premium but went back down to Plus. I don\u2019t skip much because it plays most of the music I like that has a thumbs up. I also just like to listen to the music randomly. Most of the songs and artists I like most, could not be replayed or added to playlist on Premium anyways due to licensing. Which is ridiculous considering you\u2019re paying the extra money that should cover this. Another downside is the replay/back button won\u2019t work in the car. I can skip forward using the car\u2019s track button on the steering wheel, but back to replay the song won\u2019t work, especially if the song cannot be replayed because of licensing. I also found the Premium app too confusing. Other than that, love this music. Could listen to it forever.</p>|Constantly goes offline when I have plenty of service. Now it won\u2019t play the songs on my playlists. I select a song and it chooses a random song from the same playlist. I have premium yet your licensing restrictions require that a lot of the songs I like require to be listened to on the radio part of the app. What\u2019s the point of paying for premium? I\u2019d rather deal with ads. I listen to this app while I\u2019m driving and now with our distracted driving laws in my state this app makes it IMPOSSIBLE for me to get it working if it starts wigging out on me. The offline playlists literally play crap music and only play like four songs. When you go back into service it chooses a playlist for you instead of resuming what you had going in the first place. This app is a total waste of money for premium and a total waste of time and effort for commuters without premium. Like if I want to listen to a song over, sure I will listen to an ad but don\u2019t prompt me 7 times about premium before letting me rewind like seriously how am I supposed to listen and drive when the app is asking you 20 freaking questions. Stop making things more of an effort than they need to be. The other day I selected a song and it started randomly playing other songs on that playlist but then immediately choosing another and another and so on. My songs were on a literal shuffle.

They restrict your followers because of some anti-spam thing they created. In my opinion if your fans follow you you should follow them. Tik Tok doesn\u2019t help with that especially if you want to get big in the social media world. They restrict how many videos you can like, and if you feel like commenting on the video the restrict the amount of characters you can use in that comment. It is probably based off of a study they did seeing the average amount of characters people use in a comment, but it has hurt me more than helped me most of the time I go to comment something. Now I have to rush and type up the rest of my comment before someone else posts a comment. Imagine trying to do that when people all around the world are posting comments like that, it is nearly impossible to do that. Every time I have posted a comment there is usually 4,5, and sometimes even more posted comments between my original post and the rest of my post. Then when you want to watch a live video, which is a great feature of Tik Tok btw, and you want to talk to the user that is hosting the live video the characters that you can type in that space is limited. You can\u2019t even chat with someone because your speech is so broken up. There is a limit of, I want to say 50 characters, and yes that includes spaces. That is barely enough to say anything.</p>|Ever since the new tik tok update all my friends have left because it doesn\u2019t feel the same way as it did in 2015,2016,2017 . There were more interactions with other people and with their or our own fans . The fans could ask questions and do a q and a and the creators could BFF fans and all sorts of things ! I also LOVED the featured page because there were so many talents and good things on there but on the for you page there\u2019s a lot of inappropriate things and some disturbing videos....  The old musically was a much positive and safer environment for everyone but the new TikTok is limiting everyone\u2019s creativity and TikTok is becoming very dull and well not as enthusiastic and fun it use to be . The whole new name and taking away some of the best features people enjoyed are taken away from the app that was originally musically and it used to be the number 1 app for lip syncing videos and even  number 1 for top apps . I want to make a suggestion that TikTok does a voting poll to bring back the old musically at least every other month or even permanently! So the creators of TikTok (musically) please have an actual person respond to this message and give me a raw ( actually way you feel the real person responding) response to if you would bring the old musically or all the old features of musically back PLEASE RESPOND! \ud83d\udc50and if you say no then please tell me why thank you for your time .</p>|TIKTOK is an awesome app! So much to do and explore! There app is literally so fun to play around with! TikTok has so many things to do and there are great things on this app. There are so many fun filters to use when making a video! There are also celebrities on this app! Like Halsey, Cardi B, and Ariana Grande!! TikTok is also a very caring app. They donated to 3 different charities every time someone made a video with the charities filter! I personally LOVE TikTok and to the person reading this will agree with me and I know you will! TikTok have so many activities! And sometimes if you win one, you get up to 20,000$ for winning! TikTok is an tremendous app! And I know you will love it! TikTok is also a very safe app, if something isn\u2019t looking to well, TikTok takes care of it in a blink of an eye! Once I saw something inappropriate, I reported it, then by the next 2-3 hours I got a notification that it was deleted and taken care of!! Wow! Also, if you want to make sure your child doesn\u2019t see the in appropriate stuff, you can have them have a private acc. Where you or your child can choose who sees the profile. And TikTok will know your not allowed to see that kinda stuff. If your ok with your child seeing that stuff and you trust them to report the stuff, you can choose public acc.( if you wanna get famous I say public acc would be better ;) , but it\u2019s ok if not ). Hope you download TikTok!! I hope you enjoy! -heyyy_ily \ud83d\udc98\u2728</p>", "four_star": "width: 4%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 87%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.7, 1.1M Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#4 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "2.4 GB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/yuan-zuo/id1400658718?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Creative Destruction works with: iPhone 5,5S,SE,6,6S,7,8,X,XS; iPad 4,Air,Air 2,2017,2018,Pro; iPad Mini2, Mini3, Mini4Creative Destruction is a sandbox survival mobile game that infusing sandbox crafting and Battle Royale with a light, cartoon art style.

One of the ways that they have tried to make it different is by having characters talk. This isn\u2019t a good idea! When you get on the Air Taxi, every single time there\u2019s an annoying voice line from someone that lasts the entire length of the flight. And since there\u2019s only about 3 different lines, you here the same speeches again and again and again and again!Also, the hammer dude is okay, but him talking as well is a bit unnecessary. Along with this, the \u2018tutorial\u2019 isn\u2019t actually over when you get to the menu; your first game is basically just bots, so it\u2019s an easy win for everyone. As with most mobile games, there\u2019s so much stuff on the menu that\u2019s trying to get you to buy things that you might as well give up on trying to get anything with just the in-game currency. At the beginning of each game there\u2019s a sequence where the \u201cbest dressed\u201d players are shown off. Again just another scheme to get people to buy things with real money. Then again, it\u2019s a free app so what can you expect.Other than that, the game performs well for even an iPhone 6 (unlike Fortnite cough cough) and it\u2019s fun to play with yourself and with others. Great job to the CD team for making this a great game.</p>|Ok, so I feel like when this game first came out, it\u2019s obviously just a plain copy of Fortnite. But I feel like with the recent updates, this game is becoming more of its own thing instead of just a Fortnite clone. The devs are definitely heading in the right direction. I feel like this game has HUGE potential that\u2019s just not really being taken advantage of. Like putting this game on major consoles like xBox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch, etc would REALLY help this game take off. As for feedback about the game currently, it\u2019s pretty decent. The servers are mostly not too laggy, good weapon variety, (though some are not very balanced, and the SMGs are basically ARs with a super high fire rate) the cosmetics are decent, and the gameplay is pretty smooth. Adding custom HUDs would be nice, and sometimes the game just doesn\u2019t feel very smooth. Also, I\u2019ve noticed sometimes after you see a hit marker, it takes a bit for the damage to show up. And I\u2019m not sure how damage is determined, but it\u2019s definitely not just head/body shot with drop off. Sometimes with an AK-47 I hit for 6 damage to the head, next shot I hit like 100 to the head. Overall, decent game with huge potential that\u2019s definitely in the right direction.</p>|Got the game soon as it came out to try it out I thought it was just another knock off game trying to be Fortnite but where I feel Fortnite failed I think creative destruction succeed which was in controls. Anyways I\u2019m not that high in rank or anything I\u2019m level 13 and silver rank. It\u2019s been about a week so, but I logged on that evening and spent $10 I didn\u2019t spend the jems yet though wanted to save them to get one of the new permanent costumes from this last update. Well right after that I qued myself for a match and it didn\u2019t work I kept trying I thought it was my signal maybe so I closed the app and tried again and I noticed after I tried starting any match it gave a super brief text saying \u201cyou are banned from starting a match.\u201d So my question is, first of all why was I banned for no reason? Secondly, why wasn\u2019t I notified that I was banned and lastly why wasn\u2019t I given a reason for the ban ? I want a refund of my $10 (jems still unused) because I can\u2019t even play that\u2019s unacceptable. I\u2019ve already put in several reports and haven\u2019t gotten any replies in a week. As for anyone reading this don\u2019t spend any more what so ever in this game, there is no \u201cRESTORE PURCHASES\u201d option in this game, don\u2019t get me wrong the game is fun but don\u2019t spend any money it\u2019s not worth it people are getting banned left and right for no reasons just poor programming and it isn\u2019t fair to the player.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 83%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.6, 91.4K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#66 in Action"}, {"size": "1.2 GB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/tinybuild-llc/id945888376?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Hello Neighbor is a stealth horror game about sneaking into your neighbor's house to figure out what horrible secrets he's hiding in the basement.

But the free trial only gives you a taste of the game. Because of that, I have two problems with the game: 1, You have to pay $15 for act 2-3. Just like Super Mario Run. they only allow you to play up to world 1 and play Toad Rally in the free trial of the game, and you have to pay $10 for the full game. It\u2019s tedious and overpriced. Most mobile games that are pay-to-play (such as Minecraft or Plague Inc.) only cost about $2-7 for most or basically all the game has to offer to the player.2, Each act in the game takes approximately 15-20 minutes for the average player. So the game takes up to 2-4 hours to beat. Most paid games like Minecraft or Terraria don\u2019t really HAVE an end, unless you decide to end it yourself by achieving a goal of some sort. But other games that DO have an end like Infinity Blade takes approximately 5-7 or even 8 hours for the average player to complete, and it\u2019s $5-7.Basically what I\u2019m saying is games that require you to pay to get access to the full game is overpriced, overrated, and shorter than it should be. (Like Hello Neighbor and Super Mario Run.)I\u2019m giving it 3 stars because 1. it does take a giant leap in the horror genre because of learning AI, 2. because its a nice game to play on the road (better at night) and 3. Because I\u2019m a nice guy in general so you get +1 star.</p>|I was so exited when this game which I loved watching you tubers play was available on mobile and also for free. However upon learning the the full game had to be purchased separately and was very expensive I was disappointed. However I was still willing to give act one a try but was again disappointed with all the other issues with the game.Similar to what I have all ready read the controls could definitely use a lot of improvement as it is difficult the activate certain controls most commonly walking as you just get stuck sometimes and the joy stick would not react.The upon learning that the steal series controller work for the game I got really exited as it was much easier to control. However I was again disappointed when I found out that a lot of things were not fleshed out for example not being able to pick up items, open doors or as a matter a fact activate anything with the controller instead having to use the controls on the screen.While I noticed some other problems like some of the tap controls being very unresponsive the previous mentioned issues with the basic and necessary controls made me not want to continue playing.The controls and responsiveness of those controls need a big overhaul, as well as if there is support for the controller, make it full support.</p>|Update: well it\u2019s been a couple of weeks since the game released, they have even done a game update for \u201cbug fixes\u201d yet so many devices STILL can\u2019t use the game. The $15 for the full game doesn\u2019t even bother me, I\u2019m willing to pay that. I realize it takes a lot of time and effort into building a game. You pay for games on your Xbox/PS why would games on your phone be any different?!? What does bother me is the App Store specifically says it DOES work for my device as it clearly says the same for many other people. That is misleading and it really seems like developers don\u2019t really give a $h!+. EITHER MAKE THE GAME AVAILABLE FOR THE DEVICES IT SAYS DOES WORK ON OR CHANGE THE SPECS STATED IN THE APP STORE. Because now you're starting to look like scammers and intentionally ripping people off. Giving it one more month for something to change. After that, I\u2019m done and will not continue trying with this game. The App Store tells me my iPad (iPad Air) is compatible with this game. I download it and try to go into the game and get a message that tells me \u201cunfortunately this game is not compatible with your device. Check the App Store for compatibility...blah, blah, blah\u201d WTH!?! The App Store says it IS compatible!! And yes my iPad is running the most recent IOS update! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!

I got a note, about 6 months later, saying it would be changed and it was--the cul-de-sacs are now erased from the map and the mapmaker decided to make the main road through the development 1 way, with a cul-de-sac at the end. So, now, the first 1/2 mile of every trip is all the way to the no outlet cul-de-sac at the other end of the development, which is in the opposite direction of the development exit.</p>|Even a month or so ago, I would have rated this app 5 stars, but something has happened to what was my best driving app companion.  The issues begin with incorrect mileage estimates when you type in a place your are going that, as soon as you click on the place to get directions, change and sometimes in drastic ways and always for the worse.  Examples - a place that it said was 136 miles away changed when getting directions to over 200 miles away...a place that it said was 9 miles away, when you click on it to press go turns into 14 miles away.  It also is suggesting routes with lots of turns that are leading me in circles and when I choose to ignore their suggestion because I can see ahead there does not seem to be traffic, I go the normal straight way I always do and get there 5 minutes sooner than the estimated time from Waze\u2019s indirect way.  The app has become so broken it is upsetting because it used to be amazing!  It also isn\u2019t remembering routes and crashing, which is what prompted me to finally write this review because that ended up costing me about an extra hour of time yesterday since I was trying to avoid the turnpike (and it\u2019s tolls) and unbeknownst to me, it re-routed me to take it!  It\u2019s also caused my daughter to end up on a toll road with no warning!  Waze and I are going to have to part ways if they don\u2019t fix the newly introduced issues soon - it\u2019s just become completely unreliable:</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 87%;", "one_star": "width: 0%;", "star": "4.8, 1.6M Ratings", "category": "Navigation", "sub_rank": "#2 in Navigation"}, {"size": "96.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/contextlogic-inc/id530621398?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Style doesn\u2019t have to be expensive.Wish is a mobile shopping app that lets you shop over 100 million high-quality items at 60-90% off!HOW IS WISH SO AFFORDABLE?Wish connects shoppers directly to over 100 million manufacturers, so shoppers can find affordable goods.

The only negative thing about Wish is the shipping prices. I have not ordered many times because the shipping was higher than the amount of products I had picked out to buy. So Wish if you are listening can you do something about you\u2019re insane shipping prices. I also continue to keep shopping even with the shipping. I sometimes break my orders up into two orders because that sometimes will save on shipping. It\u2019s also great when you find a really great product that you couldn\u2019t get anywhere else at the prices you can find on Wish. I have bought a lot of clothes for my daughters my Granddaughter my husband and myself (remember to order bigger sizes). I have bought a lot of makeup, skin care products, hair products, phone chargers, phone cases, things I haven\u2019t seen before, basically you name it and I\u2019ve probably purchased at least once. A hint that I go by when purchasing something and that is to look and see how many people have purchased an item before I purchase it. If I see that 1000 people have bought one item and 25 people have purchased the same item but maybe a different brand or company etc., I\u2019m going to purchase the item that 1000 people have bought vs the one that 25 people have bought. I also ALWAYS make sure to look at the reviews on all the items I purchase.</p>|While one must expect some measure of risk from buying unreturnable items sight-unseen, most of the things my husband and I have bought range from acceptable to great. My husband buys more gadgety things - watches and Bluetooth sunglasses - and I\u2019ve taken chances on clothing, jewelry and plant seeds. We\u2019ve gotten used to waiting a few weeks for things to arrive. In the interim we find ourselves going back for \u201cjust one or two more things.\u201d This means that we are getting frequent little surprises. When something shows up in the mailbox we call it Wishmas. Clothing items are \u201dmore or less\u201d as pictured. Fabrics tend to be a little thinner and more coarse (less drapey) than expected so far. One top was so unsuitable for me, I am just going to donate it. Of course the cute models are stick thin so one must imagine what the items will look like on regular folks. Many reviewers post photos which are helpful. Other dresses fit well and look fine. The balancing factor is that the prices are so cheap that even with a separate shipping charge for each, it doesn\u2019t take much discretionary income (and we have very little) to get something that will brighten your day or make a lovely gift. The variety of things seems unending so it\u2019s fun to browse. Items generally arrive sooner than their estimated delivery dates.So, I removed one star for the risk factor, but so far we are still liking and using Wish, so try it out.</p>|I\u2019ve been a customer of wish for years. I think it\u2019s fun &amp; often come across things I didn\u2019t even know where available. However abt 15% of the time the products are not as shown or the quality they claim to be; I don\u2019t even bother with buying clothes here anymore because that was a joke! But the worst part is getting stuck with items I don\u2019t want or flat out cant use. Why is returning something SO HARD!? Recently my son bumped me while I was going thru my cart &amp; I accidentally hit the pay button. I tried to cancel it immediately but to no avail what so ever. I was unable to immediately cancel this &amp; when I tried to stop it thru customer service it was nothing more than a useless collage of suggestions at me, not me getting to state what exactly was wrong. I tried several times their way but kept getting messages saying it would take 2-3 business days for them to even respond! So of course it will go thru by then &amp; I will have to start the gawd awful process of trying to get my money back.... This IS NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY! I have kept several bad products over the years but enough is enough. Why is there no confirmation before making the purchase? Why are you so hard to reach?! A retail business is nothing without customers so why are yours treated with disregard? U should b as concerned with the entire experience as much as you are with taking payment! I believe I will b moving on to a new &amp; more customer friendly shopping site...</p>", "four_star": "width: 16%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 732.4K Ratings", "category": "Shopping", "sub_rank": "#3 in Shopping"}, {"size": "151.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/square-inc/id335393791?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "It\u2019s Friday.

After a solid 2 good years of excellent service, I\u2019m not sure what to think of this app anymore. I am currently missing at least $1000 that seems to be \u201clost\u201d. It\u2019s been 6 business days now and no response, very little follow up. I was out of town, across the country with last than $30 after this glitch. The merchant claims a refund was processed. Initially, I was hesitant to believe the merchant, until two other bills paid with cash app had the same issue. Cash app takes the funds, merchant never receives them. Or, merchant releases the funds, cash app never receives them and I don\u2019t have them. The email system for customer service is really inconvenient. When customers are missing funds, having to send an email to an unresponsive system is pretty infuriating. I appreciate the honesty in stating the wait for a response may be up to 3 days, but this is crazy. This is a lot of money that has significant ramifications.  and a huge inconvenience.******I have since updated this review to 4 stars. Given the previous years of good service, customer service finally reaching out, and the refund being received. However, the Customer Service system can be a bit inconvenient. I have to deduct a star for that. I understand that it\u2019s probably extremely cost effective but it can make us consumers feel alone in rough times.</p>|Can\u2019t say enough good things. It\u2019s such a simple app even my parents and grandparents can understand how it works (enough). If my kids were any older, I\u2019d almost be afraid they\u2019d use it too much!I use to use Venmo for everything thing from renters to gas change for carpools. I\u2019ve had a bumpy time with them between occasional times when it just wouldn\u2019t connect to my bank account or even respond at all, then the next day it\u2019d be fine. To a weird identity theft issue that happened using my Facebook login for multiple apps including Venmo and thousands of dollars were laundered through my account! All these issues have since been resolved but the security aspect and intermittent bank communication issues were just too much!Now with the Cash app, I\u2019ve referred it to colleagues, friends, family, tenets and I\u2019ve never had issues and had the most simple time using it for a couple years now! It\u2019s not just a simple to use app, but it\u2019s highly convenient to have instant transfers to my bank for a few cents fee. I haven\u2019t seen another way to instantly transfer funds like that unless the other party uses the same bank as me. All around, it doesn\u2019t matter how old/young adept or confused you are with technology and apps, this app is the best I\u2019ve ever used for money transfers; business or pleasure!</p>|So when I first encountered Cashapp I thought it was the way of the future. I could transfer funds easily amongst family members and pay bills. I even had my job direct deposit my check into the account. Then my first hiccup. Seems the system shut down for the weekend and funds could not be used even if they were present. I thought let me find out what\u2019s going on with the card. So I searched for a number to reach customer service. Found out there isn\u2019t one. All correspondence is being done through email or text. Okay strange but maybe it was because they are a way of the future. The problem with that future is that text can often be misread or in certain cases the terminology used by email sounds robotic. So I let it pass. Just recently I was out trying to use my card when nothing would go through again. I\u2019m checking app which is showing me there is a balance but nothing moving. Figured it was a glitch like before and I would wait. I check the app again and now it shows a new bank card number and has informed me(again by email) that my account has been closed. I still have a balance in the account but can\u2019t retrieve it because 1 the account has been closed without warning 2 I can\u2019t contact a customer service rep to talk about the situation. Smh. Looked up Sutton bank phone number. Nothing. Square inc phone number. Nothing. Needless to say I\u2019m done. Moving everything over to Chime where at least I can speak to someone.

I have a few suggestions to make the game look a lot more professional. For one, the stock photo backgrounds. It doesn't make sense to put a picture of trees as the backdrop because it doesn't have anything to do with the game. I'd say it looks a lot better and cleaner if it was just white. You could unlock different colors and such. Even full backgrounds, as long as they fit in the animated style. The overall color scheme doesn't match in general, too. The orange of the level bar clashes with the target. If you picked a soft color palette and made the target bright, then it'd make the object of the game more clear. Then, when you go into fever mode, you could make the background dark and have all the colors super neon like the balls become. I think these tiny fixes could really improve the whole feel. Also, what the heck does the x2 do? It seems like it\u2019s just there to make it seem like something\u2019s happening. Your points don\u2019t double, the amount of points you get from each ball doesn\u2019t double, and the balls don\u2019t double. They just split into two equal lines.</p>|Actually, I like the ads in this game. You\u2019re probably thinking, what is he talking about? Well, let me explain. When your on a really hard level an ad pops up. Take this ad as a break. Or, when you want to pause, just wait for the ad instead of closing out or whatever. This will result in all your ballz lost. This game is also super fun because it\u2019s more of a challenge. And people say, THIS APP IS BOMBARDED WITH ADS!!! You are incorrect. There are some games where you just tap a button to check something out or when you exit out, it immediately gives you an ad. But, there are only 2 times where you get ads. One is in the middle of the round, and at the end of the round. If you are really having trouble with ads, i haz a solution. TURN YOUR PHONE ON AIRPLANE MODE. And if you are taking your time reading this review, I sincerely thank you for your kindness. AND PLAY POK\u00c9MON GO!!!!!Sincerely with all my heart-Braden</p>|I think the game is excellent but there are so many adds. It is very relaxing to play.  I just want to know what the backgrounds have to do with the game. Here are the pros: relaxing, fun, and is very addicting. I love this game so much. I just downloaded it and I have not stopped playing it. Here are the cons: there are so many adds and the balls don\u2019t go in the hole. I wish there was no adds in the middle and in the end. The other thing is the balls. When I shot them in the whole they do not go in. The last thing is the backgrounds. I don\u2019t understand why there are trees as the backgrounds. I think it should be just white or have a solid color. Yes I am happy about the game and yes there is more pros than cons so that is why I will continue to play this game.

Although I like it, it seems to keep you buying the  \u201cno add\u201d purchase. I bought it once and was disgruntled about the fact that it only let me not have a add once!! What is up with that? I bought it for 2.99 and it only kept the add away one time. My words to the creator is if you are slamming for money you just did it. I love the game but the fact that it wasted 3.00 dollars of my money is ridiculous. Sorry to have said this but that is the truth I recommend you not to get this app for the following reasons. 1. You spend roughly about 3.00 dollars for an add block that does not block adds.2. Like some of the other reviews said, that you cannot buy an item that allows you to have more lives without having to watch \u201cuseless adds.\u201d3. But also there should be more power ups in my opinion. You get a few rulers along the way to help you get the perfect plank size. That\u2019s it. Although the game is addicting you spend your money on things that won\u2019t give you what you want. I am not a generous person when it comes to rating especially not if you don\u2019t have those three requirements. Again I recommend that you do NOT get this app or pay money on the add block because you will not have a pleasant surprise. That\u2019s why I only gave the app two stars and THATS generous.</p>|This is a very cool addictive game - but :1. When I buy an ad free version for 2.99, I expect all the ads to go away - and  it does not!2. There are no options to buy lives. When you fall from the plank, it lets you continue once if you watch a 30 seconds ad and the second time you fall game is over! What? Why can\u2019t I buy something to continue playing? Why do I have to watch useless ads? Please provide 3 undos that the user can use for each game.  You should also allow the user to buy more undos (or save) 3. There are no boosters - there is something called a helper line that you get if you watch useless ads. 4. What\u2019s the goal of this game? What do I gain if I collect characters? It\u2019s unclear how to collect characters or whatever - no help anywhere. Developers should provide boosters and helpers that users can buy to make the game more interesting. Also, we want to compare our score with other high scores - please show proper game levels and high scores so players have some kind of goal.This game has lot of potential, but as is it\u2019s just very incomplete. Please remove all the ads and allow users to buy helper lines and continue playing. I am not interested in watching long ads.</p>|I LOVE Plank! But recently something happened. I enter the game and the builder character comes up on the column and that\u2019s all that happens. The buttons to play won\u2019t come up. I really REALLY LOVE this game. It\u2019s my favorite game to play. Can you please fix this? It\u2019s been like this for about a week. I was reading other reviews to find if other people were going through the same situation and only one person reviewed that it happened to them. My last resort is deleting the game and downloading it again, but I don\u2019t want to lose all my animals.\ud83d\ude3f I thought it was going through an update but it stayed like that for a long time.

First off there are a billion ads on this game... every single time you lose (which is going to happen all the time) an ad rolls every time and it is infuriating. Also, there is this beginning part you have to play every single time you die which is so obnoxious. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s there, and it makes me not want to give it another try because the beginning part is so annoyingly repetitive. Another complaint I have with this game is that some of the levels are so unbalanced it\u2019s ridiculous. Some levels are far too easy and some levels are near impossible. There are a few levels I have never been able to beat, and there are a few levels I\u2019ve never lost on as well. Also, when there are a lot of things going on on the screen, it can get horribly laggy and make the game not worth playing. Finally, the game is just plain boring. There has to be something else added to the game to make it more fun to play. There has to be something else than a balloon design I can earn from playing the game that makes me want to come back to it. There also needs to be sound added, and it needs to be more visually stimulating than just different colors every level.</p>|I think it gives you a nice feeling when you are playing the game..but some of the objects that you try to block are way to small and hard. You try to get your shield as close as you can to the ballon but if the shield touches it it pops! And you can\u2019t defend those objects, I don\u2019t know why it is rated greatest game of 2018 because it\u2019s a little bit a waste of money. I wouldn\u2019t get it if I where you. and also no one talks about the app so no one really knows about it. The millionaire that made this is a big fool and made a stupid game that isn\u2019t even popular to people in my school...trust me. When there is a game that is known, people talk. Like the game fortnite. But OH EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT IT is not true. What a big waste of money guys! DONT GET IT!!! The people that are writing good things about it is because it\u2019s THE NEW GAME!! SO HAPPY!!! UNICORNS \ud83e\udd84 AND RAINBOWS \ud83c\udf08 but they hate it inside. They just like to get the top game because it might be something someday. Well not this game. Don\u2019t get this game. Do yourself a favor and save your 1.29 on fortnite or a real game like helix jump. What a waste. The most fun part about this game is picking out the flipping ballon color. Big deal.</p>|Overall, I really enjoy this game but there are is one thing that is very annoying. My biggest problem with the game is how whenever you get to level 27 it restarts you back to one every time! I have gotten to 27 a lot and then it just resets to 1 and then when you do it from there and get 27 it still resets you back to one. I have beaten the game multiple times but of course do that flaw it never actually lets me finish the game. This game is pretty easy but annoying if you can never actually finish all 45 levels. I have gotten to 60 levels but it never acknowledges that. Because I just keep going to 27 then it restarts even though you didn\u2019t pop the balloon. So I have gotten to 27 multiple times on the same turn but it never lets me finish the game. I hope this makes sense but please fix it because I want to beat the game already and not have to keep restarting multiple times on the same turn...... yes it keeps my score the same through it all but I want it to actually tell me that I have completed it and I want it to say 45/45! Please please please fix this soon! But I don\u2019t have any other complaints..... the game is pretty easy just again annoying when you can never win and can only lose..... thank you for reading this if you\u2019ve made it this far!</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 70%;", "one_star": "width: 7%;", "star": "4.4, 739.1K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#5 in Adventure"}, {"size": "188.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/lyft-inc/id523004506?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Try Lyft for a friendly, affordable ride whenever you need one!Use Lyft to travel to your destination and enjoy the best carpool of your life with our trusted and highly-rated drivers.

Enter it right before you request a ride. Go to the Payments tab in the app and enter the coupon there. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing!!The app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver's face, phone number, and car make and model. It's amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button!!! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!! Lyft is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don't see why you would ever use a yellow cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it's still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn't have to say anything more than a short comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I'm very happy and I hope Lyft continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Lyft much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!!</p>|I\u2019m almost satisfied the Lyft app, however, requesting a ride can be so difficult for me. About five times a week, I need a Lyft to get me to my SAT tutoring session at very specific times. Initially I tried scheduling Lyfts in advance. The scheduling system is horrendously unreliable. Most of the time, drivers arrive way too early, outside of the pickup window I requested. This is inconvenient for me because my destination demands a punctual arriving time. On one occasion, I had to pay a cancellation fee because the driver waited too long for me (note that the driver arrived way before the scheduled pickup window). On the other hand, drivers plan to arrive later than the pickup window. I\u2019ve had to turn away drivers because they were too far. My pickup window would be 15 minutes away, meanwhile, the driver would arrive in 30 minutes... As of now, I can\u2019t even depend on scheduling. Whenever I feel like it\u2019s the \u201cright time\u201d to schedule a Lyft to take me to my location, I just press the ordinary request button. Unfortunately, the calculations of ride time and scheduling are now projected onto me, which makes this feature very inconvenient to use. I have to get to a location that\u2019s 30 minutes away, but instead I have to request a Lyft over an hour in advance.</p>|If I could give four and a half stars I would. The only reason for a half star off of five is because how their scheduling works. I travel nearly every week for work and I really enjoy the convenience of Lyft to the airport (about a 35 mile ride). Since I am usually leaving the house around 3:30 am to 5:30 am I schedule my ride the night before.  The problem is I never get a confirmation that a driver has accepted my route until about 10 to 15 minutes before they pick me up. Every driver has indicated that they accepted my route the night before, so why was I not notified then?  I\u2019m not looking for the specific drivers name or make of car, it would just be nice to know that a driver has accepted.  Why this is important:  Recently Atlanta had forecast of possible icy conditions around the time I would be leaving for the airport. But up until about 15 minutes before I was to leave I had no idea if any Lyft drives were actually working (which would be completely understandable given the weather situation). Had I been given a confirmation when the driver accepted, a lot of anxiety could have been avoided. Please update the app and procedures and I will be happy to give it five stars.</p>", "four_star": "width: 4%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 94%;", "one_star": "width: 0%;", "star": "4.9, 4.3M Ratings", "category": "Travel", "sub_rank": "#2 in Travel"}, {"size": "127.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/pinterest/id328135727?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Looking for inspiration?

I keep seeing the same content over and over again. I only follow around 3000 people's Ms follow more every week. I have 9000 followers--which my number of followers slowed down significantly when they changed the feeds and algorithms. I can no longer see the people who follow me--even though my number of followers go up, it's no longer adding profiles to the followers section. I am so sick of seeing advertisements and sponsored content that have NOTHING to do with anything that I would ever want to see from Home Depot (I think we all kinda know about Home Depot at this point) to Pantene hair commercials. The settings for automatic video play do not work. And dare I use the \"show me more like this button\"; CLEARLY Pinterest's taste level has a bug since it usually looks NOTHING like what I've just pinned. I preferred the only method of see who else has pinned this pinned so that you could start following others with your same taste level and subject matter. Pinterest has become almost as bad as Houzz for the masses and has become very hard to curate sophisticated collections of idea boards.

However, there are a few things I would like the app to change. Please, can you add a section where customers can write on the order that there are placing. I sometimes want my order more customizable than what my options are. For example, when I want no ice on my drink there isn\u2019t an option for that so I have to stick with the ice. Or when I know there other drink options at the restaurant I would like to be able to have the option to swap a drink for another one. Lastly, I want the customer service feedback to be faster than it is. I want a confirmation email right away when I have a problem on one of my orders. Recently, I was missing fries for all of my meals in one of my orders. And I did report it. But, I want to know sooner than the time given that I have someone caring about me. The app should also offer a customer service phone number on the spot for those that want it. Uber eats is what I will stick with, but I\u2019d like to see these few changes. Thank you!Update: I was refunded later that day. Appreciate the help Uber! Still would like a confirmation right away though that you received the complaint. But, refund was done in same day so that evens it out. Changing to five stars for now.</p>|The application itself works great and has many great choices in my area. Unfortunately, I will no longer be using the (eats) service due to the rising booking fees. I could understand the fees based on distance for standalone companies hiring their own drivers. Uber has drivers who are intending to drive these distances for pay and can continue with more rides after leaving the destination (home) rather than having to drive back to the starting destination (restaurant). A pizza delivery through the pizza company 5 minutes away has a 50% lower delivery cost than Uber does for a restaurant in the same general area (within .2 miles). This is unacceptable. I guarantee you will continue to lose customers, as I already know of several other who are moving to your competitors for this very reason. I\u2019m disappointed I will not be ordering my favorite tonight through Uber eats because it is $9 for a 10 minute drive. The restaurants are already inflating their prices from their in store prices. Don\u2019t add to the problem.Update: 2 days go by since the initial review. I opened the app out of curiosity and was welcomed by a notification touting lowered booking fees. From what I noticed (based on my ordering history) there have been no lowered prices. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not wasting my money on this any longer. I used to order regularly from Uber eats but this has gotten out of control. Fix yourself, Uber.</p>|So I used to use Postmates and Door Dash until I noticed how they didn\u2019t care for customer service, and if anything happened with you\u2019re experience with them then you\u2019re SOL. I used UberEats and I do love how if the restaurant makes a mistake they\u2019re willing to help you out, but I had the worst experience just because I made a mistake and tried to fix the issue myself. If I would\u2019ve been able to cancel my order within the 5 seconds that I placed it, the the restaurant would have never made it and I could\u2019ve re-ordered; however, I like several others have had to deal with waiting on the line just to get horrendous customer service from representatives that transfer you without consent and have to explain to the next unhelpful person. I\u2019ve never had to deal with something like this and feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to especially if I tried to fix my own mistake without needing my money back. If your company is going to allow this type of behavior and service over a petty few dollars, then I\u2019m willing to scoop down to your level and actually dispute the charges and be done with your app because when someone doesn\u2019t give you your money you cancel their accounts so I heard. And to anyone reading this don\u2019t make the same mistake I did, make sure that you are 100% certain that\u2019s what you want, or else you\u2019ll go through the same ordeal as I did trying to get it resolved.</p>", "four_star": "width: 6%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 90%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 1.3M Ratings", "category": "Food & Drink", "sub_rank": "#2 in Food & Drink"}, {"size": "180.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mcdonalds-usa/id703260918?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "This App is going to change the way you experience McDonald\u2019s\u00ae.

Somewhere around 3 to 5% of the time the order does not recognize that it needs to timeout. Theres been times I go back to the app and my order from the previous day is still there waiting for me to get in the drive-thru. And I have had some orders process incorrectly in those situations. I remove the items from the cart and redo the new order. I wish there was a reset cart button or someway to tell the app that the previous order was finished. Closing the app several times and reopening doesnt clear the cart or help it realize that was yesterdays order. Right now I have this mornings order stuck in my cart and it thinks the order hasnt delivered to me yet. Im ten miles away and done eating. And because this is happening, im not getting credit for many cafe drinks I am buying. Im supposed to have my 5 cafe drinks already and twice during this most recent promotion I havent got credit for my drinks when this cart problem happens...Occasionally you find yourself with a McDonalds employee that doesn\u2019t understand how to check out a mobile order and they do something wrong to the order and want to be paid. This happens less often now, but still I run into a drive-thru employee that I have to instruct that the order is already paid, no fault of this app or the developer of course.</p>|They have many deals that aren't in store, many buy one get one free breakfast and lunch sandwiches everyday. How is that not amazing? 2 sausage egg mcmuffin for like 1.60 each? Some days they even have had a free breakfast sandwich with any purchase, and recently they had a free breakfast sandwich no purchase. These are promotions for my local football and soccer teams(go Seahawks and Sounders!)The online ordering just started yesterday for my mcdonalds and everything went smoothly. Got inside and had my order ready, skipped ahead of about 4 orders in front of me. I just hit the check in button and my order number popped up on the screen! One of my friends that works there was asking me some questions about the app and ordering. Got to customize my burger on the app too. Two double hamburgers with lettuce and mayo. Adding mayo is free and it adds to the burgers for sure. I am sorry most people live in a state where the McDonald employees have lower than average IQ and don't know the app YET(online ordering has been out for only a short time) The scannable deals are great(just order what you want, after they punch it in, then scan your phone. You don't even need to tell them because it'll pop up on their screen after you scan, though communication is still nice)</p>|I have found this app to be very useful to avoid long drive-thru lines or having to go inside a store - the closest store near me, for example, is notoriously slow. I like pre-ordering and pulling to a curbside pickup spot to wait while I relax. I also like the discounts. That is worth 5 stars. But the reason I (originally) give the app 3 stars is that I've had about a 75% success rate using the app due to a variety of issue.  Here are some problems I've encountered at different times and different locations: App said a store was closed (it was 11:30 am and store was very open), the app wouldn't let me enter a curbside pick-up spot so I had to go in to get food, one store didn't have a designated pick-up spot at all and one time I ordered and paid for two apple pies (in app purchase) but upon delivery the store said it had ran out of apple pies so I got unwanted cherry instead - is there a way to know this before I order and pay? Overall I will continue to use this nice-to-have app.Updated: I have deleted and re-installed app and no longer have issue with entering curbside pick-up spot being missing.2nd update: growing much more happy with this app. Last several uses have all been spot-on with no issues and fast curb-side delivery results thus I\u2019m moving rating to four stars.</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 81%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.6, 267.3K Ratings", "category": "Food & Drink", "sub_rank": "#5 in Food & Drink"}, {"size": "153.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/roblox-corporation/id431946155?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Roblox is the ultimate virtual universe that lets you play, create, and be anything you can imagine.

How do I begin? ROBLOX is an AMAZING APP! But yet again there are bad things to it! What should I talk abut first? The good thing about it, or the bad thing? I\u2019ll start off with a good thing! ROBLOX is an AMAZING game! Great ways to make friends and RolePlays! To be honest sometimes RolePlays Can be kinda of cringy, but it\u2019s totally fun! I really enjoy these games (Bloxburg, Royal High, Work At A Pizza Place, Robloxian High School, Roblox High School, Roblox High School 2) because they are great games to RolePlay on! Mostly Bloxburg! You can make your own house and design it the way you want to! And it\u2019s so realistic! And you can have a nice RolePlay with your friends! But now I have to talk about the bad things of ROBLOX. ROBLOX can be a fun game and all, but kids are getting cyber bullied from it. It\u2019s either because they don\u2019t have robux. I think that everyone who makes a new account should at least be given 90 robux to start off with. The other problem is that kids are also getting to addicted to the game! Kids might have to do something important like a project or homework and may leave it at for last minute because they were either laying in bed playing ROBLOX! I\u2019m not saying that I don\u2019t get addicted, because I do! I also think that the other problem is the Tags! I once tried to RolePlay but it was so difficult trying to say something when it went tags. Thank you for reading my comment about ROBLOX, and sorry it was long! Bye!</p>|Roblox is a. Great game but people with no robux  get cyber bullied and that\u2019s not good but I\u2019m glad u can report cuz I feel bad and u can role play play with other people and it will not let u say bad words u can make friends follow chat play games like bloxburg royal high and other games that are fun and u can costumize ur character and join all ur friends and cyber bullies mostly always get banned from a game there are many different games to play to have fun when ur bored u can make group chats but u can only have a limit of 200 friends but it\u2019s still very fun and u don\u2019t always have to accept friend request sometimes people might online date but just report them the could get banned for that like me .im friends with friends from school and cousins and my brother and other people who are really nice just don\u2019t get scammed by the people who say they will give free robux if they have builders club that means they don\u2019t need ur password and those aren\u2019t scams but people who need your password they could hack ur acc so plz be careful my cousin got hacked we don\u2019t know who hacked her I thought she was planking me but she texted me saying she couldn\u2019t get in and I sent her a pic that she was in a game and luckily she got in bc she put her email , And don\u2019t cyber bully u could end up being banned it doesent matter if u have robux or not roblox is a game for fun and it is fun have fun role play or do something else fun. When ur bored just play roblox =D.</p>|Ok so, ROBLOX is an amazing game that I\u2019m happy people from over the world can join. But, although it\u2019s a great game, there are bad things in the game that happen.           One bad thing about ROBLOX is that online dating. Young players could be in serious trouble with ODers. Kids don\u2019t know who to trust and who they can\u2019t trust. Like, \u201cI\u2019ll give you free robux if you date me.\u201d Kids could be in danger just because of this problem. So stop ODers.            Another bad thing about ROBLOX is scammers. Players playing a scammers server, for example, putting in your password for \u201cfree robux\u201d but truly never gives you robux, if just gives you your account being hacked. So please ROBLOX, if someone makes a new server called \u201cFree Robux\u201d please delete the content immediately. Who knows how many accounts have been deleted.             AAAH!!! This reason makes me really mad. Reports don\u2019t even work!!! Just like the reasons before, what if someone is ODing?! And you can\u2019t do ANYTHING about it!!! And what if someone is scamming?!? SORRY, CAN\u2019T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE REPORTS DON\u2019T WORK!! Please ROBLOX please, make the report button useful for once!            Overall, ROBLOX is a great game, just please change some things about it! I know you guys have like a list of rules and guidelines, but WAKE UP! Not all players follow the rules! And someone wanted to OD be before, but of course I didn\u2019t do it! So please, make ROBLOX a safe place again. \ud83d\ude09</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.6, 812.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#2 in Adventure"}, {"size": "287.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/niantic-inc/id1037205060?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "NEW!

It was super popular and the servers couldn\u2019t handle it. Now the developers push a new event almost all the time. Getting mew was fun and challenging(Ditto). Celebi and Spiritomb were arduous to obtain but Meltan has been extremely challenging because I don\u2019t have a Nintendo switch. They have also pulled off some very awesome community days once a month where you get a similar ambiance to when the game first came out. Tons of people playing! They also used one of them to introduce a new mythical Pok\u00e9mon in a very creative way. I have enjoyed the new raid and research updates. We just need more ways to get silver pinaps. Trading has been introduced to the game in a way that doesn\u2019t ruin it and trading rare Pok\u00e9mon with strangers is costly but with people you interact with daily it\u2019s cheap. The game is mostly free to play but I have personally spent some money on it. There was an egg event and I wanted more incubators. Anyways I wasn\u2019t ever forced to buy anything and it isn\u2019t like other apps where they throw sales in your face as pop ups every time you log in. You can earn 50 in game coins per day without paying a dime but that can be drastically easier or harder based on where you live. In the past year this game has drastically changed into something truly addictive and fun to play. I can\u2019t wait to see what they bring to the game next year.</p>|I am loving all of the events and things we have to look forward to. Community days were a great idea. Friends and trading were wonderful updates that added a lot to the game, though I wish that there was an option to toggle off the exact location and map directions in the gift you send people. Even better if you could turn on/off per friend level or even individual friends as well as an all on/off. Also, if you could create a kind of lure for gyms where raids are happening, and nearby players could see that and head over because they know people are there to raid. Lure could last 5-10min so people can wait for it to run out (and if they don\u2019t want to wait, they don\u2019t use the lure). And nearby players can view the raid and leave like a thumbs up or thumbs down so others know someone is on their way. The GO community has really come together and made raid planning possible in a lot of places, but this would be more inclusive to those that haven\u2019t joined their local community or that live rurally and have a hard time getting enough people. These are just suggestions for improvements to an already amazing game that I am pretty happy with, Pok\u00e9mon GO has come a long way since those first several months of release where I always seemed to be annoyed at Niantic. So, well done :)</p>|I love the game and its easy to use interface but I and all of my friends at school agree that your amazing game lacks some necissary content to be a truly great game. I belive you should add trading pokemon above all else and along with that casual battles with near by players. Now for my personal favorite addition is that some people have a daily struggle with living in a small town like mine where there is literaly 1 pokestop in all of town and you never go near it so that results in having a very limited supply of poke balls which is by far the most important item in the game because without them you cant catch anything which results in the lack of xp which means you cant level up. You cant get good cp pokemon (much less pokemon at all) which means no gyms or raids. To combat this major issue I propose you and some sort of daily spin or add more pokestops and gyms.    Now I doubt you (the devs) will see this much less read it all but if you do I greatly appreciate it. Thank you as I hope this may help bring life back into this once amazing and well played game.P.S. ( I am saying this not only to make this game more fun for me but all of the friends I play this game with are compaining about a few of these issues and I would like to continue playing the game with the game with them as this is the only game I play and I fear they may quit playing if you do not add content. )</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 61%;", "one_star": "width: 17%;", "star": "4.0, 148.2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "N/A"}, {"size": "76.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/hulu-llc/id376510441?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Only Hulu gives you access to the largest streaming library so you can watch thousands of shows and movies, exclusive Originals, past seasons, current episodes, and more on your favorite devices.

People are saying it\u2019s not user friendly but I don\u2019t see that at all. I\u2019ve never had a problem with crashing, the app not opening, or the app not loading properly. Whenever I\u2019m in a location with poor service, the app still loads all the show selections and I can still watch it without constant buffering like the Netflix app. It also looks sleek and not so plain like Netflix. I honestly loved the new overhaul update and when it first came the rwd/ffd would go whenever you touched the screen but now you have to tap the screen to do that function. So, in my mind the problem was fixed. I love the app, people just need to cool it.</p>|Why is it that your app is the ONLY app I have issues with streaming on my iPhone?? I had to delete the app and now that i have re-uploaded the app when I go to login to my profile it states that my internet connection is the problem but I can literally log into Netflix and stream immediately after getting that response from your app!!?? So, if you can manage to take my $7.99 a month without any problems then I should be able to use your service just the same. But that ain\u2019t the case and I would like a resolution immediately or a reimbursement for services not rendered. This problem has been going on for the past few weeks for other customers as well - isn\u2019t there a team of IT staff that should be addressing these issues??!!??</p>|To describe Hulu\u2019s new user interface as torturous barely scratches the surface. Touching the screen to access the player controls causes the entire image to be obscured. The controls remain on the screen for several seconds after playback resumes, leading the user to touch the screen in an attempt to make them go away (so the video can be viewed); this usually results in changing the position of the \u201cplayhead\u201d or \u201ctimeline\u201d control, skipping to some other random part of the program. There is simply no excuse for this poor of a design. But at least Library navigation is utterly bewildering, indicating the developers are fully committed to making the app unusable in any respect. Airplay support has also been removed, which is simply hateful.</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 84%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.7, 910K Ratings", "category": "Entertainment", "sub_rank": "#2 in Entertainment"}, {"size": "113 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/venmo/id351727431?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Venmo is the simple, fun money app for sending cash quickly between friends and shopping at your favorite online stores.

But this company has so many issues that it has yet to develop past, that to me personally make Cash App or even Apple Pay more useful. One major issue would be the lack of help available when the app fails to work. I recently had to get a new card because my old debit card wasn\u2019t working properly anymore. So after attempting to add the new card back, Venmo quickly said I added to many cards and prevented all future transactions. Meanwhile I\u2019ve only ever added my credit and debit card to this app, so I\u2019m not sure what \u201ctoo many cards\u201d relates to. But as for help, their inconvenient hours don\u2019t relate to the days you would expect individuals to use the app. What I mean is Saturday and Sunday are excluded from help service, but a typical bank works these hours because when money issues arise, you definitely want the quick service. LEARN VENMO. A second issue comes from this too, and it\u2019s that transactions made won\u2019t be processed over the weekend and that just makes life harder for the people who needed it to go through at an adequate enough time.</p>|I downloaded the app because my family member referred it to me to send me money out of state and i tried to transfer it to my account and it made my wait 4 days which was fine because it was around the holidays so I expected it to be delayed but the 4 days passed and the money just sat there so I contacted someone through the chat and was informed my account was frozen which is already annoying that I wasn\u2019t informed to begin with and was just waiting as well as the money not even being able to be refunded when I asked then I could not verbally talk to anyone on the phone to address the situation and ask them why my account was frozen I had to keep talking thru the chat which was very inconvenient it took about 4 more days of me sending them my i.d. As well as bank statements just for them to tell me my account was deactivated and I was no longer able to use it and bc I was in violation of who knows what because I constantly asked why ?? And they never answered me ...I gave them all my information which proved my identity this was my first time using it as well as sending them statements showing all my transactions which I\u2019m absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with that either I have had that card for years with no problem so this whole process was a nightmare and still was never able to use this app my advise use a different app DO NOT USE VENMO</p>|I wish PayPal and Venmo were actual real banks because I certainly feel like the financial portion of my life is not complicated at all when using both of their platforms (app &amp; website). I\u2019ve never had an issue even when there was a small bump in the road like when my instant transfers weren\u2019t showing up for example. They took care of it immediately. Any time I\u2019ve ever had to call customer support I am always treated and helped kindly, respectfully, friendly, and patiently. I really couldn\u2019t ask for a better way to manage my funds. I mainly use Venmo and PayPal for both personal and business. My only gripe would be I wish they were a real bank with a brick and mortar! Even better would be to replace institutions such as ::ahem:: it rhymes with Tells Cargo and other banks that seemingly only charge fee after fee even if it\u2019s charging a fee that was their error on top of charging another fee. My real bank experience lately has been an utter nightmare and I am truly grateful to have the option to use Venmo and PayPal whenever possible! Please become a real bank soon! Whatever it takes!

But I have to say how this app has been so amazing for our family! My 5 year old son has autism and receives a lot of special services including seeing numerous teachers and therapists at school. Before this app I was never able to keep up with all the emails, found it impossible to go through everything and respond to everyone in a timely manner. Once his school started using Remind, all the important communications, the stuff directly from his teachers regarding things in his specific care, now had their very own home on my phone, and the unique style alerts easily combined to separate these important messages from the noise of my constantly roaring email inbox! With this app I have been able to GREATLY improve my communications with my son\u2019s teachers and therapists at school and it allows so much better cross communication between the entire group on his team as well! I think every school should be using this app. Teachers, get your classroom on here! Parents, send Remind invites to your children\u2019s teachers! I love this app so much and hope to see it used everywhere soon!</p>|I began using the remind app back in 2013 and parents were completely excited and surprised with how the app was able to connect school, teachers, and parents. Now that it is six years later I teach middle school and it has been essential to use the remind app not only to give reminders to parents about upcoming events at school but also to use it as a platform to communicate with parents when assignments are missing or if their student is not performing to the best of their potential and I love the fact that I can send parents photos of their children while they\u2019re at school having a good time.  The remind app has offered parents a window into our little school house on a daily basis. If you haven\u2019t used remind app yet as strongly encourage you to offer this means of communication to your parents and you\u2019ll see the benefits of the parents trusting you and being aware of things ahead of time and just the natural relationship that becomes one of mutual respect when parents and teachers were together! THANK YOU REMIND APP! \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd13</p>|I love this app. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I think you should be able to send longer messages. I often have to send 3 messages to relay the week\u2019s reminders, which is annoying to me and the parents. Also, I have to keep a parent contact log and I wish there was a way to sort the dates of messages sent directly to the parents that aren\u2019t whole class messages. I have to go into each parent and do them one by one and it takes forever- so a sort drop down menu filter would be nice.What\u2019s great? The fact you can go back and look at old messages. I actually had a parent try to sue our school because she said her child slipped on the bathroom floor and lost a permanent tooth. On the day her daughter was playing with the sink water, she did slip and lose a tooth, but her mom texted me through remind and said, \u201c thank goodness the doctors said it was a baby tooth, her permanent one is getting close to coming in.\u201d Lawsuit saved!

I can\u2019t remember the actual statistic but I remember reading somewhere that people tend to share negative experiences (especially when it concerns restaurants and/or retailers) far more than they will ever share positive experiences. I tried to read through as many as possible and try to throw out the ones that seem somewhat emotional rather than objective - Four instance, that review who awards a restaurant one star not because the meal was terrible or the ambiance was not up to par, but because the wait staff did not refill his or her sweet tea immediately or because maybe they were out of lobster that night. I wish there was an algorithm that could possibly average ratings that were fair and objective only and trash the outliers. Otherwise, I think this app is extremely useful and I love it!!!</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 72%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.3, 257.9K Ratings", "category": "Travel", "sub_rank": "#3 in Travel"}, {"size": "161.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/green-panda-games/id669978473?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Get ready to face the toughest mountains full of spikes, volcanoes and eagles!

Just wanted to point that since that can happen when you watch the add for a second chance you should a protection thing where you can\u2019t die for 3 seconds and if that does happen lesson learned do not do second chance near a fire blower thing. Oh and I also found a little cool thing about the adds you can tap the top right corner and it gets rid of the add like there is a invisible x there. Oh and last but not least the shivering when that happened I panicked and tried to move because it happened when I wasn\u2019t moving because I was relaxing there is no pause button so anyway when I moved I died because I was not thinking at all then after I was trying to see if you did die from shivering and you didn\u2019t and when I died I was about at 200 score so I was very very mad. Plus there is weird floating trees sometimes and there is so many things to die from</p>|This is a great game a lot of fun and keeps me entertained for quite some time. It\u2019s a nice simple pleasure not too intense nothing to get mad about and keeps you pretty locked in. My only problem probably among most of the reviews is that the ads are insane! So many of them at such a constant basis and yes I understand if I buy the \u201cpremium version\u201d then they will go away, but I don\u2019t believe I should have to pay to not see all of those ads and at times it makes all apps not worth using once I play it a couple times I get annoyed by the ads and just don\u2019t want to play anymore not just this game but most of the games out right now. I understand it\u2019s a way for you to make some extra cash but in the reality of it it\u2019s just wasting my time from a game I highly enjoy. This could be a 5 Star game without a doubt without as many ads not them all gone just a few less. Again if you made premium into something cooler like new game modes different maps or even hammers I\u2019d think about it but just for the main focus to be getting rid of ads seems kinda absurd to me.</p>|So I enjoy playing this game but there are some major major problems. My biggest problem with this game is the developers seem to be money hungry. What I mean by this is after every time I die literally every time there is an ad without fail. Even if I don\u2019t click the restart button it will immediately start an add I mean how low can you guys get. In other games it\u2019s usually an option to watch an ad but you force it on your consumer that\u2019s really sad to be honest. I don\u2019t play your game to look at asinine ads I do it to have fun. My second problem with this game (as far as I know please correct me if I\u2019m wrong) is it has no tutorial. I mean it\u2019s pretty straight forward but this game doesn\u2019t tell you anything. When I start to climb there is a point no matter how much I grow the pickaxe I can\u2019t get it to stick. So I make it short and I die immediately because I can\u2019t go higher. Maybe I\u2019m playing it wrong but I\u2019ve tried many different ways and still I can\u2019t get the pickaxe to go in. Please fix your game and get rid of the dang ads! I mean when gaming apps were first developed I don\u2019t remember any ads.</p>", "four_star": "width: 7%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 89%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.8, 52K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "N/A"}, {"size": "128.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/soundcloud-ltd/id336353154?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "SoundCloud is the world's largest music and audio streaming platform \u2013 180 million tracks and growing.

It was perfect. I pay for SoundCloud go+ because I wanted the ability to save my playlists offline and listen wherever I go. And for a long time it worked flawlessly. My music was always there and it was just perfect. But recently I\u2019ve noticed that my playlists will occasionally removed themselves from being saved offline which is frustrating because I\u2019m then unable to listen to my music on my ride to work without using data. Also recently the app has been crashing very frequently. If I\u2019m driving and listening to my playlist, it will just crash right in the middle of a song and the app will close itself. This is also very frustrating because I can\u2019t very easily open my phone to start playing my playlist again while going 60mph down the highway. This app used to be perfect and used to work flawlessly. I dont know what happened. I would really appreciate any type of fix to these issues because I do not want to switch to another music app. However if these issues don\u2019t get solved I may have to.Edit: I deleted and reinstalled the app and so far everything is working as intended. Apart from that period of inconvenience this is an amazing music app. 5 stars for sure.</p>|Sound cloud is a very good application are use it every day to play my favorite tracks but here are just a few suggestions that could make sound cloud even better: you should be able to listen to all the tracks and no previews but there should still be ads because how else are my favorite artists going to make money? Also when users first Download and open the application there should be a to tutorial on how to play music, how to create playlist, how to post tracks, how to customize your name, how to follow people, and lastly how to Customize your profile picture because I still can\u2019t figure out how to do those last three things. And finally when you click on the three dots next to a playlist one of the things that pop up should be added to another playlist because when I was trying to create a playlist of all my music(combine all my playlists I had to sit there for two hours straight trying to get music on the other playlist and then I decided to give up and I still had about 1000 left lol. And I still haven\u2019t finished. Also users should be taught how to comment on tracks and sound cloud polls so you can connect with your favorite artists! I hope the makers of SoundCloud see this review and add these minor things so Soundcloud can be way better! :-)</p>|So I\u2019ve been using this app for the past 3 years and it has been amazing, but somethings I would wish could change as well as some issues I\u2019ve ran into. The first thing is the UI, if I type in a song and I spell it wrong I wish it could put up something close to that and not say \u201c No Results\u201d. Second thing is that I wish when you went into your saved playlist that you would start at the bottom or the newest song and not the top, but those I can live with so I own an IPhone X, I\u2019m not showing off or anything but this thing has amazing speakers and for some reason when I play a song it crackles and pops which is soooo annoying, I\u2019m an audio geek and I can not listen to a song when it cracks and pops it\u2019s just infuriating. And the last thing is something that I\u2019ve wanted for so long is to be able to post songs from your phone because not all of us own computers, and or laptops but the option to be able to post songs from your phone would be awesome. I hope you bring these ideas in consideration and hopefully are able to fix that bug but anyways I love this app and this is the only way to listen to songs that are posted by non singers or artists.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.5, 59.8K Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#3 in Music"}, {"size": "254.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/life360/id309681604?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Life360 is the world's leading realtime, location-sharing app, and is the best way to coordinate with family and friends.

I am so satisfied with this app &amp; as I have said before, I recommend it to friends &amp; family! - I've had this app for almost a year and have been satisfied with it until recently we (my family &amp; I) started having some issues with the accuracy of our locations and places we were shown as having been when we we're never in those areas.  As I wanted to get this app as I have two teens I wanted to test this out for myself as to not jump to conclusions and accuse anyone of not being where they say they will be.  I turned off my GPS and then waited 1 day to turn it back on and now I cannot have the app recognize that the GPS has been enabled once again. I have deleted the app as per the instructions and re-installed it, I have restated my phone (I have an iPhone 6s Plus) and followed those instructions.  I have gone to settings and made sure all the tabs are checked for my location including the background app refresh and the life360 still does not recognize me as having the GPS on.  This is a great concern to me and I did send a message to them, and the response was \"it's been sent to the developers\".  I really liked this app and has referred it to many friends, I truly hope this gets resolved quickly as I would like to continue using life360 and once this gets updated and fixed I will change my review.</p>|This is a must have app for parents and anyone with dependents (either children or parents) with compromised cognitive abilities. My wife found this app and placed it on my phone after an accident left me loss of short term memory. After the accident, I would literally get lost just trying to go home. My doctor independently recommended the same app to keep track of me. We now use it for everyone in the family, and always know where our kids are, even when they are traveling in a car. It gives everyone incredible peace of mind. We don\u2019t even have to call one another to meet up - we just use the app to track to whomever we are supposed to meet. And when someone is running late, say, to dinner, we can accurately predict when they\u2019ll arrive by tracking their travel. It\u2019s a really, REALLY useful app. And as the original family member for who it was purchased, it gave me great peace of mind knowing that even if I got lost, my family can track directly to me. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone with kids today, for pure safety reasons. You can track to your child\u2019s phone in real time, without help from anyone else, which is critical in the early moments of an abduction. I actually hate most apps and find most of them useless, so I cannot overstate how surprisingly pleased I was to finally find one that\u2019s actually very useful, very simple, very effective, and, in my case, very necessary.</p>|I use this to daily to see where my kids are on their commute to and from school and sports.  Two of my kids go to high school in a different state and one is a walker to her school.  I like seeing them er their safely without having to call them to distract them from driving.  Many times, we are in carpools to sports.  I can see if my kids are a few minutes away so I can warm up dinner.  Or when picking up, I can locate them and click on \u201cget directions\u201d and it takes me right to my child.  Sports complexes are big and sprawling.  So this helps me locate the exact field or side of the parking lot. One time, I knew a bad storm was coming and I could see that my son was only around the corner and would be home before the storm hit.  When my husband is away, I can see when his plane lands.  I can meet him easily.  I have used it to find my kid when we separate at the mall. So without this app, in order to find out where each person is and to get their eta .. it would take a phone call and conversation with each person.  I glance at my phone and get all that in seconds.  I don\u2019t have to distract them from driving to do so.  This is the most important app I have on my phone and cannot live without it.  Currently, we have a snowstorm hitting us hard  and school was dismissed early.  I am nervously monitoring everyone on life 360 and counting down until they arrive home safely.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 85%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 349.1K Ratings", "category": "Social Networking", "sub_rank": "#5 in Social Networking"}, {"size": "197.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/rein-technology-limited/id1439057441?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Connect letters to guess the correct words to pass each level.You may consider yourself a master of word games, but here is a completely new word link game waiting for you to take the challenge!

Finding that word does \u201cpay\u201d out in \u201cgame coins\u201d that allow you to buy hints.  That\u2019s their only purpose or use, as far as I can tell.

The only thing remotely like directions is masked as the first several stupid-easy \u201clevels\u201d when a pop-up indicates how to run your finger along the letters to make the words, and that for help you can touch two icons: one to mix-up the letters and one to get hints.

They\u2019re unique, associated with an animal, and give you a little inspirational saying, and you never know what they\u2019re going to say so it feels like a surprise. I just love them. So the only thing I would ask- because I love these mind stones so much- is if maybe y\u2019all could please add more? I\u2019m 2 mind stones away from having all of them, but I would love it if there were more added in the next update since right now there are just 16. Although it does take some time to reach 16, as the max number of stars you can receive per day is 3, I\u2019ve been playing for a while now and would love to keep collecting more!</p>|Game started getting stuck loading at 1% then freezes and crashes. Can't even open it half the time... Repetitive words, made up words, ads after every single level...made the mistake of paying to remove them because at first the game is really fun and addictive. But once you get to higher levels and like ten in a row have the same words repeated just kinda makes it annoying after a while. Anyways there is a lot of potential to be a good game it just needs some fine tuning. The reward system needs work as well. It is very confusing right now, what are the flowers for? The gold rewards seem kind of skimpy as well. Also you lose your bonus streak even if you enter in a legit word and sometimes that legit word gets you the bonus.....I can understand losing your bonus for entering in something that is just gobbledegook but why not extra points for real words? Annnnnd then you can go to the next level and enter in that SAME word from that last puzzle and it accepts it?! So convoluted. Also after the game stopped opening I uninstalled it and reinstalled it to see if that would resolve the issue. I was also logged into Facebook at the time might I add. When I reinstalled the game and logged back in I had lost all my progress....what's the point of logging in when all it does is show me what my friends scores are. Also there doesn't seem to be game center support either... Wish I could get a refund.</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 74%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.5, 184.1K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#31 in Word"}, {"size": "166.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/life-church/id282935709?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "On more than 350 million devices around the world, people are reading, listening to, watching, and sharing the Bible using the #1 rated Bible App\u2014completely free.

I couldn't wait to read God\u2019s Word everyday. It makes things easy just to have it on my phone, or when I am searching for particular verses. I also enjoy looking for the plan I need, depending on my circumstances. I really have no major problems with this app except sometimes it takes longer to launch; when you exit to go to a concordance app and go back to this app, it will take a bit of wait to get it going. It doesn\u2019t launch right away. Also recently they've made changes to creating Bible images. Although they have added more fonts, it is harder now to fit in a number of words you desire in a line. You can no longer control the amount of  words you want in a line. It used to be that you can have longer lines of words. Or you can actually control how you want yiur verses to fit by using two fingers to expand the verse onto the image. Now, you can\u2019t do that. They have limited your freedom to control tge creation if images so that verses cannot be spread out or laid out as you want, as it used to. This is the one thing that the update has changed that I did not particularly like. However,  overall, this app is my go to in everything everyday. I use it way more than any other bible related app or any apo for that matter. I am hoping they would bring back those image creation freedom back, then it'll be perfect. Today i found out they brought back those text boxes for images. Im so glad.</p>|Great bible app! It has the ability to read the scriptures to you while you read along which I absolutely LOVE! It has the ability to highlight and compare verses to other translations to try and understand the scriptures more fully.  Also I love the function of creating verse images. And I love that they have updated it so I can format it to fit my wallpaper of my phone... so it can help me memorize scriptures better by saving at as my phone\u2019s wallpaper. The only suggestions I would like to see updated is if they could allow the ability to share links in the comments or at the very least the ability to copy the link from the comment. As of right now you can\u2019t copy anything from the comments. I would love to share links to sermons that is pertaining to the verses my friends are highlighting or studying... I\u2019m sure there a lot of glitches and safe guards you would have to put in place to insure no one can share anything inappropriate. As a parent I like knowing my kids can\u2019t click on anything and see anything they shouldn\u2019t, so not sure if the benefit would outweigh the risks...  Also if they could give us the ability to look up web searches for images that would pertain to the verse I\u2019m creating an image for... if not no biggie. I just search it in my web browser and save the images and create them after they\u2019ve been saved to my phone but thought it might make it more seamless. All in All a great App!!! I love it and use it mostly everyday.</p>|I can't remember ever writing out a review for an app, but this does deserve one. The app makes my Bible available at my fingertips on any of my devices, so intuitive and in different versions. No excuse for not reading in the bed, on the road or anywhere I chose to as long as I have any of my devices with me, even if I am offline as pre-downloaded version resides on my device and available offline. There are different reading plans and there are audio versions as well I believe. I personally prefer to read rather than be read to, but I have used it on some instances when I'm in bed and too tired to read and I'll rather just listen as I wind down to sleep. Besides, it will be of immense usefulness to those that are visually challenged in one way or the other.I can keep writing all day about many things I love about this app, but chose not to bore you. The point is that there are no cons or negatives I can think of, and definitely no reason not to get this. Install this on all your devices and use it. Listen to the Word from the source rather than listening to these numerous wolves in sheep clothing so plentiful these days twisting the Word to suit their own agenda and to pad their pockets.I believe in obtaining my information from the primary source, I don't now about you but I think you should too. The Bible is my primary source for the Words of God and that's my ultimate guide and reference point.</p>", "four_star": "width: 6%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 93%;", "one_star": "width: 0%;", "star": "4.9, 3M Ratings", "category": "Reference", "sub_rank": "#1 in Reference"}, {"size": "371.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/paypal-inc/id283646712?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The improved PayPal mobile app is the secure way to send, receive, and access your money from almost anywhere.With our improved app, you'll get the convenience you want, paired with the secure transactions you've come to trust from PayPal.

It has literally been the easiest \u201cbank or bank-like\u201d company I\u2019ve ever used to dealt with. I know my money is safe when I use Paypal and My purchases are protected too. I use it frequently to send money to and from friends &amp; family. The app is super easy to use for this feature. I really don\u2019t understand when people tell me it\u2019s \u201ctoo complicated\u201d literally a child with a 3rd grade reading level could do this in 5 minutes. The app also has fingerprint recognition, so it\u2019s easy to sign in every time. I don\u2019t know what that other person was saying about 2 form identification... It\u2019s never made me do that. I believe it may be a setting you can access from a desktop version of the site. Great customer service!!!! They always take care of my problem quickly and without hassle. The app is simple to use, and very quick for sending &amp; receiving money, which is what most people use if for I believe. It would be nice if it had a few more features you can only get on the browser version. AT LEAST make a more desktop-like version for IPad! I do not like how it looks like it\u2019s just a larger version of my phone app. iPads are basically replacing larger versions of computers. They\u2019re just as fast, have more memory, and larger ram and processes to speed than many computers, new to only a couple years old! Please start updating the apps to reflect that! Not just this one...</p>|I called Thursday and was on the phone with someone for over an hour to correct the issues on my account with a pending order and it is still not fixed! I have called 4 times before that and was on hold for over 2 hours. I am very disappointed with this customer service. You get transferred all over and no one can help you. I finally was told that my account would be corrected within the same day and I would receive an email after our phone call. Well, I got neither. The pending balance was supposed to be refunded and then my paypal account was supposed to be credited correctly. This is MY money that they are keeping from me! This app is just horrible too. The email option never works and when you Finally get a hold of someone they don\u2019t even follow through with helping you. It\u2019s been days and I still can\u2019t get this issue fixed or even get a hold of anyone. I\u2019m probably going to have to wait on hold for another 2 hours just to tell someone my account still isn\u2019t corrected. I will never use PayPal to transfer money again. There are many more apps that are way better options and not so expensive to use. While I was on the phone with this lady she told me I would have to open another dispute to not pay the nearly $10 fee they charged me.. for money I still haven\u2019t received! All in all their customer service is horrible because it\u2019s nonexistent.   I\u2019m hoping this review will get someone to actually help me quicker but I seriously doubt it.</p>|I have been using PayPal for many years\u2026 What I have come to realize is that Paypal is without a doubt basically better than a bank account plus having a make account operated into it it basically allows you to borrow your own money no I\u2019m pretty sure the Mark policy change goes into affect in changes those reasons and now I know why either change to go because basically you can get cashback with money you don\u2019t have overdraft your bank account do that same thing every day for two or three days don\u2019t push it but you can grow your own money three days before payday and then on payday take your 200 you borrowed to begin with and finally pay it but you can let Paypal pay it for you for few days basically because they will allow you to overdress your bank account and with my bank is long as I get the funds in by 11 PM I don\u2019t get an overdraft fee and I can overdraft PayPal again I can take the money out of Paypal from Kroger cashback pay it and then do it again for another day get paid squared away and good now unfortunately I have messed up that process and I really can\u2019t lose with Paypal so I\u2019m going to pay them their money but Paypal is the best decision I have ever made financially it\u2019s a lifesaver!!!!</p>", "four_star": "width: 7%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 90%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.9, 1.6M Ratings", "category": "Finance", "sub_rank": "#3 in Finance"}, {"size": "220 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/kiloo/id330629809?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Presented by Kiloo Games and Sybo Games.DASH as fast as you can!DODGE the oncoming trains!Help Jake, Tricky &amp; Fresh escape from the grumpy Inspector and his dog.- Grind trains with your cool crew!- Colorful and vivid HD graphics!- Hoverboard Surfing!- Paint powered jetpack!- Lightning fast swipe acrobatics!- Challenge and help your friends!Join the App Store's most daring chase!A Universal App with HD optimized graphics for retina resolution.Subway Surfers is compatible with iPhone 4s, iPod 5, iPad 2 or newer.iOS 7 or later OS\u00a0version is required.</p>", "subtitle": "Join the endless running fun!", "title": "Subway Surfers", "similar": "  aa\n,  Zombie Tsunami\n,  Temple Run\n,  Jetpack Joyride\n,  Temple Run 2\n,  Geometry Dash Lite\n", "two_star": "width: 2%;", "price": "\u00a9 Kiloo & Sybo 2012 - 2019", "inapp_purchase": "N,/,A", "autor": "Kiloo", "reviews": "|The game has improved and developed in so many ways, I should know cause I\u2019ve been playing since I was young. When I saw that the lil character (forgot his name) has stars on top for when he hits himself I was like \u201c Awe that\u2019s cute\u201d. Anyway, I have had no problem with the game and I love it a lot. I have to admit that the ads are very annoying but that\u2019s how you guys make money so I understand. I only have one problem and that is that when I got a new phone I cried because there wasn\u2019t a way to transfer my data only my score. I had gone so long and meet my favorite character Lee. Yeah I had the majority of the characters too and a lot of completed spray paints but Lee was my favorite. I was upset. But I grew out of it \u2018cause I thought to myself \u201c your soon going to be an adult and your crying over a character\u201d. That ended my favoritism. By the way, I read that a lot of people don\u2019t like the high prices but I like them because it makes me want to play more and more and have high goals to want to complete them. Basically the higher the goal the more challenging and that\u2019s intriguing for me. That\u2019s all I wanted to say... Thank you for dedicating yourselves to make this game I appreciate you guys. Have a nice day!Bye!  :D</p>|One of the things I like about this game is that there are no ads. They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.</p>|This game is a great game to pass the time and can get addictive to it I mean wow \ud83d\ude31. I like that the background changes and how you can get keys to save your life too. And the score board that you can look on like if you haven\u2019t played in months then ya your probably at the very bottom. But like if you play once and your good then you can land yourself in bronze!!!!!! A couple things that could be changed is when you get on the game we\u2019re the boy is painting the train and to want to start an ad pops up!?! And I think it\u2019s meaning to do that so you press the ad but if y\u2019all don\u2019t change that for the other people then don\u2019t press it right away let the ad come up and then press the ( x)   Also like when a new character comes along it\u2019s like 100,00 coins?!?! Like how am I suppose to get that much without paying $2.99 in the world but in app price it\u2019s quite pricey!! And with the mystery box\u2019s it\u2019s always 1 out of a thousand percent gonna be one of those things that gets you closer to unlocking a new character well I\u2019ve played this game for about 3 to 4 years and I\u2019ve NEveR unlocked them still popping up with mystery boxes it\u2019s ReALly annoying too. There are quite a lot of things you app people need to fix on this QUITE A LoT.

It\u2019s nearly impossible to progress and accumulate more cars without spending serious amounts of money.  I\u2019m talking like 20 dollars or more.  Notice you can still play and enjoy the game, but in order to progress you\u2019re either faced with grinding the same races for days or weeks and waiting for card packs that only give you a fraction of a chance to get the car you need to move onto more races.  You don\u2019t even get much options spending money to get a certain car.  Instead the developers want you to spend money to get these card packs that only give You a chance of collecting blueprints for your car.  In this way, asphalt 9 is kinda forcing you to pay a lot of money or else you\u2019re stuck for potentially an infinite amount of time in the same spot which renders the game like a demo.On the flip side the graphics are wonderful and the entire gameplay experience is smooth and engaging.  Load times are extremely quick (within a few seconds) and it is very entertaining.  I could sound hours playing if I didn\u2019t run out of gas.  Admittedly I have spent some money on it and that could be why I\u2019m enjoying it as much as I do too.  Overall it\u2019s a great game to kill time with but don\u2019t expect to get new cars and progress without spending a lot of money.  Oh, and the game only works with an internet connection.</p>|I remember in 2005 when there was Asphalt Urban Gt. The game was still a baby game. The game eventually grew into a teenager. Its weird stage a game with pixelated graphics and choppy animations (Asphalt 4 Elite)Then it quickly grew into an adult. The game was not the most realistic which was great that aspect made it unique. Knockdowns were still uncommon (Asphalt 6 Adrenaline) and the game was extremely vibrant. It was simple and simple goes good with vibrant. The game became  less vibrant and more realistic and less vibrant (Asphalt 7 Heat). The game featured darker maps and realistic features. It offered free cars for every class and my favorite thing in Asphalt ever WHEELSPINS. The car went round in circles and landed on a prize for you. This function was truly unique. Then the game became elderly and quickly got Alzheimer\u2019s (Asphalt 8 and 9).Instead of giving it the occasional 5 bucks per year. You had to dump hundreds of dollar into the game for it\u2019s medical expenses (completing the game) it was truly sad that the game was corrupted with money. It would be great if Gameloft Could come out with a game called ASPHALT FLASHBACK or ASPHALT REWIND (or something along those lines) that featured the option to buy and or play older asphalt games available for the apple lineup.

I have completed many orders without a hitch and made good money in doing so, and while the Poshmark fees are higher than you might see on some other apps it balances out with the convenience of having all the postage already paid for, and only having to pay for shipping materials (or even better just using free USPS envelopes and boxes). And as a buyer, I have found great pieces for myself and my family at very low prices, and everything has arrived as described with no problems. Although it\u2019s definitely best to bundle when you can and only pay for shipping once since it\u2019s kinda frustrating to pay $6.49 for shipping no matter whether the item you\u2019re getting is $5 or $50.For me, this app is great for selling fashion items at are too nice for a garage sale or a store like Plato\u2019s Closet (no offense to them, they\u2019re great for cash on the spot), but maybe not what you could take to a consignment boutique. It\u2019s also better than consignment since you basically get paid on the spot for your items. And there\u2019s no minimum balance or stupid fees for making a bank withdrawal (unlike Mercari) and there\u2019s the option to get a physical check if you\u2019d rather not provide your bank info. Overall a wonderful app, I\u2019ve been recommending it to everyone I know!</p>|Poshmark has increased my sales by 50% I have increased my sales tremendously I wish that they had something in place that protects us as sellers I have started to rely on this income so much I don't have to work the long hard hours I used too but daily I stress at anytime I can be closed down I wish Poshmark had an agreement with some of us top rated sellers that we have some kind of protection I also would love if we have a long list of 5 star reviews and with posh for a certain amount of time that a buyer shouldn\u2019t be able to return a item they bought on impulse  I wish Poshmark looked at us individually when we get a return allot of time effort goes into every sale not to mention a return can hold our item for days and takes away from true buyers as it stands at anytime our selling privilege can be taken away if your a top rated seller there should be certain steps in place a warning and short term suspensions before you just get locked out I feel posh is a mall and we are stores in the world of cyber space lol I have become dependent on this income sometimes investing ten thousand dollars on an order I will be selling on posh and a new Cust service rep can easily click close on my account I hope since posh has grown they have a chain of command where only experienced reps can make that decision Posh has changed my life I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity and would love some sort of security Poshmark love being part of your team</p>|Use JNVWS for 5 dollar credit, it'll knock down the price of what you purchase and upon use will give 5 bucks in return, a win win! Now on to the review, Poshmark is by far my favorite app to sell on. The layout is simple and easy to get the hang of, and there aren't unnecessary updates to it. The majority of sellers and buyers are cordial and I've never had an issue on either end with anyone all the times I've used the app; plus there's quite a bit of hard to find items on this here that make hunting for them a lot easier. Refunds, should you need one come in one to two days depending on when it was requesting the buying stage, and customer service isn't too terrible either. A few cons: The downside is that shipping remains the same no matter how small or light something is which I hope they change soon or at least give more shipping options for; paying six dollars for shipping on a necklace is a bit overkill. They also take a twenty percent cut from your sales which is understandable since they need to make money too, it just unfortunately means that people will often have to price higher on an item no matter how small, just to get a bit of money back. The kids clothing party, although helpful, needs to be expanded on for a greater range of items to be shared like junior (teen) items. Hopefully in the future they resolve this but as a whole posh is pretty great.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.7, 110.9K Ratings", "category": "Shopping", "sub_rank": "#5 in Shopping"}, {"size": "385.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/quick-atom-ltd/id1054877909?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Animated avatar emojis are coming!

Which is stupid and what the main comment I read said bitmoji didn\u2019t have a search button look again dumnut it\u2019s there alright, you almost had me fooled for a minute.  It\u2019s seems cool at first but you still have to create yours all it does is set the pictures up side by side.  But if you are me and only use Snapchat filters to take selfies then this is no help.  Honestly though who takes pictures of themselves close up and without any filter or stickers....NOBODY!!!  They say if you deciding on whether to try it or not just try it but I say otherwise.  It\u2019s too bad I really had high expectations for this.  This is highly annoying I don\u2019t have a clue how it got four and a half stars all I know though is that from me it gets 3 lousy stars.  I wouldn\u2019t suggest this for anybody.  That goes out to especially teens since I\u2019m always using Snapchat and bitmoji works with Snapchat I\u2019ll always stick with it.  But I mean you can always download dumb apps with no purpose wasting storage on your phones for fun because I mean that\u2019s entertaining.  Whatever though your choice over mine.</p>|So I saw an ad on Instagram and I was told I could get a photo of myself and make the character out of that. NOPE! Wrong. 98% of the good clothes are locked and the emojis themselves are just unappealing. The hair only goes down to the characters shoulders which is super dumb, and you can\u2019t even change your body type. PLUS it\u2019s another one of those apps, that when you download it, it immediately asks you to buy their crap. By the way, it\u2019s not worth it. How do I know? I just do. I can tell it\u2019s just a waste of money. Just download Bitmoji, this is Bitmoji but you have to pay for it and there\u2019s less options for your avatar. If you see a GOOD REVIEW, it\u2019s a bot. These people have bots make good reviews just to mislead you in to thinking its good. Then you download it, you might buy the premium, BOOM realization that you wasted your money. Don\u2019t trust any good reviews, okay? If you don\u2019t believe me, download it for yourself so I can prove my point.</p>|Thank you for making a huge hit with the new zmoji improvements!  It is a lot better since I first downloaded last year. The addition of the daily \ud83c\udf81 was great while they lasted. I miss them. All the updates since then prove that you listen to us, the consumer. You added a lot more options for free clothing styles, and more free looks, so that upgrades this review to 5 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f, from  the first review of like 1 or 2 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f I did purchase a few styles, but they will last forever, and to me they will never go out of style, so it was worth the $4.99 for each one. Thanks for improving this app. If you didn't make these improvements I would've legit deleted it. 2 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc</p>", "four_star": "width: 5%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 89%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.8, 76K Ratings", "category": "Utilities", "sub_rank": "#8 in Utilities"}, {"size": "409.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/voodoo/id714804730?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Hit hard or go home!Hit your baseball as hard as possible and upgrade your stats!

So if I press the collect button I might as well press the double button cause what\u2019s the whole point of pressing the collect button when every time it gives me an add like EVERY SINGLE TIME !\ud83d\udc4eit\u2019s annoying me . And  I know it\u2019s supposed to get money and all but like either what button you choose you have to watch an add ! \ud83d\ude11 that\u2019s probably why the game has 4 stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f I usually give advice to apps to change there app a little to make it more better  but I\u2019m not anymore cause apps don\u2019t take any ones advice they just leave the app just like that how it was originally made . But they might if there were an upgrade or update but anyways hate the ads ! REVIEW OVERRRRR . Oh and if there is a player reading this please put   # stick with no ads    At the end of your review it\u2019s for people that don\u2019t like apps with so much ads and thank you \ud83d\ude1b &lt;3 oh anddddd if you are a girl it\u2019s ok to play this if you like it cause I\u2019m a girl even tho the game title is baseball boy doesn\u2019t Necessary mean it\u2019s for boys only and thank you again \ud83d\ude1b &lt;3# STICK WITH NO ADDSNOWWW THEE REVIEWW IS OVER \ud83d\ude1d</p>|The game itself is okay, there are a few things that could be fixed (will mention later) but what kills me with the game is that there\u2019s an ad between EVERY play, sometimes 2 and sometimes right when you open the app. There is an option to collect your reward or double your reward and watch an ad, well you\u2019re getting an ad either way. If you choose to double you just can\u2019t skip it after 10 seconds and still get the reward. You may be thinking \u201cwell just turn off cellular data\u201d but don\u2019t bother. The app \u201cglitches\u201d and won\u2019t even open if you try that. Interesting glitch there guys. Anyways, about the fixes. It\u2019s great when you get a \u201cperfect\u201d swing/hit except that all the shhtuff is in the middle so all of my perfect swings result in hitting a light post or a crack in the sidewalk and my ball goes backwards \ud83d\ude11 ONE time my ball hit a car with a perfect swing and it blew it up which was awesome but it seems that was the only time/doesn\u2019t work with any other object?? Also I NEVER hit any springs, I\u2019d rather hit springs than diamonds \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Finally, it took me a while to figure out you can tap for a \u201cbounce\u201d and keep your ball going a little further. This is great but as I\u2019ve progressed the feature seems to be getting worse/less accurate to my taps. Overall, significantly reduce ads for the regular collect option and increase distance potential for \u201cperfect\u201d swings and I\u2019ll be happy \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc</p>|So Ive been playing this game for a bit now and I must admit it is a blast to play. Super easy and intuitive to learn and use, pick it up and put it down with ease. Perfect for someone like me who does not want to have to invest chunks of time playing if I don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t at the moment. So far, I do love the game. Ive not played long, but what I have has been a blast. What I don\u2019t love is that between rounds, you win and claim coins to be used for upgraded items. They offer you 2 choices, take the coins or double your reward for watching a video. Cool, I\u2019m down with that. The rub is that I don\u2019t always want to double my reward, so I click just take coins. The issue I\u2019m finding is that 90% of the time I\u2019m being force fed an ad anyway without any reward. If I wanted to watch an ad, I would have chosen double my reward. I didn\u2019t, so don\u2019t force me to watch one. And I am choosing double my reward most of the time as it helps me build up quickly, so I\u2019m not trying to avoid the ads. I just don\u2019t want an ad between almost EVERY round as most ads are AS LONG as a round. That\u2019s too high of a price to play this game. It shouldn\u2019t be almost a 50/50 split between game and ads, thats way way too much. I don\u2019t normally review games, but I do like this game and hope something can be done about all the ads so I can really fully enjoy this game.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 74%;", "one_star": "width: 7%;", "star": "4.4, 338.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#20 in Sports"}, {"size": "95.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/doordash-inc/id719972454?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Food delivery anywhere you are, from a family picnic in the park to your date night at home.

Not sure why, but most of these reviews seem to be complaining about drivers or issues outside of the app. I can tell you firsthand, DoorDash treats it's drivers excellently. I've been here since the beginning and there is a reason DoorDash has been holding up against it's competitors all this time. They do care and will do anything above and beyond to resolve issues that occur. Out of every 100 deliveries or so, maybe three-five deliveries will result in a significant issue. In this case, it becomes the drivers responsibility to balance interactions with the restaurant, customer, and DoorDash to get everything resolved. Unfortunately, time is money to us drivers and the more time we have to devote to an issue, the less we will get paid since we cannot deliver more food. This results in drivers simply not caring, not making sure an order is right, not personally delivering the food, and various other problems. Despite the training and advice DoorDash provides us on different scenarios, a few drivers will not care. So instead of leaving a horrible review when something like that happens, please contact DoorDash so that they can do something about it. Many of us drivers do care about your food and getting it to you as fast as possible. We will go above and beyond to make sure everything is right but please do not let those few drivers lead you to stomp in the face of this company.</p>|I\u2019m finally throwing in the towel after the latest. I believe one out of every eight deliveries goes smoothly but I will highlight a couple of gems I\u2019ve had recently. In one order a couple months ago, we had ordered three sandwiches, delivery time said 45 minutes. Well, over two hours later our driver finally arrived, went out to meet him and he actually threw the food at me and ran off. Why? Because, not only was he an hour and a half late, but we also discovered that he ate one of our sandwiches. I understand that DoorDash has some bad apple drivers here and there, but their initial response was to simply give us a $5 credit... Gee thanks DoorDash, that wouldn\u2019t even cover the cost of the sandwich. The next incident happened just last night. Placed my order at 5:40PM waited an hour and a half and found out they had cancelled my order, after the driver picked it up, because the driver had to take someone to the hospital. Normally, I would give the driver the benefit of the doubt, but based on past experience, my guess is the driver wanted a free meal. They actually credited my meal, so I placed the same order which, apparently, created confusion with the drivers and the restaurant. I didn\u2019t get my food until 9:00PM. The response from DoorDash is another $5 credit... Again, gee thanks. It\u2019s impossible to get them on the phone, so I\u2019m not even going to try and I\u2019m just going to try GrubHub.</p>|I live right here in suisun City California where I have been living for three years. I have never tried to order anything from an app before. I have tried to see if Uber eats, postmates, or even GrubHub delivers to my apartment. Well, thanks to a friend of mine who is blind but has a bit of sight told me about the app because he ordered Popeyes chicken from there and he really loves this app. I have a number of friends from out of state who really dig this app and gave it five stars. It really works if you are totally blind and can\u2019t drive. I will eventually try it and see what I think. I downloaded the app on Friday to see if they deliver where I live and put my home or apartment address in. Well, I was blown away by the restaurants that they are partnered with. Even favorite fast food restaurants that I like is on the list like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Carl\u2019s Jr., nations giant hamburgers, Jack in the box, Wendy\u2019s, Applebee\u2019s, Buffalo wild wings, and the list goes on and on. Even Denny\u2019s. For those who is blind like me and want to look for a place to order, give this app a try although the customers is negatively slamming it down. Like I said, I\u2019m going to eventually give this app a chance to see where it goes for me. Oh!. The three apps that I mentioned don\u2019t come to this area unfortunately. I am so thankful for my friend that directed me too doordash.</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 86%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 2.1M Ratings", "category": "Food & Drink", "sub_rank": "#1 in Food & Drink"}, {"size": "177.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ambatana-holdings-b-v/id986339881?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "letgo is the biggest and fastest growing app to buy and sell locally.

In my opinion, it comes off as a very safe app. The letgo team gives you accessibility to safety tips when speaking or meeting with a potential/seller. You don\u2019t have to put your full name or your real name, for that matter, into your bio. Of course there are always going to be weirdos and scammers on every buying/selling apps, but you should be able to weed them out the majority of the time. If you can\u2019t when there\u2019s clear signs (i.e. they won\u2019t answer you back, they\u2019re willing to pay above the asking price, the spam you, say that you can just ship the item to them, or ask you to use another app to communicate) then it\u2019s probably not a good idea for you to be buying and selling. \ud83d\ude02 I understand that letgo can\u2019t pick out every single person who is using the app with ill intentions, but they do actually do a great job at moderating accounts and the items they sell. You set your own prices, but letgo can also price the average amount of the item that you\u2019re selling for you. Personally, I think the app is easy to navigate in a way that it is simple to go on your profile and edit item prices and descriptions and searching for a specific category of item you would like to find. I really enjoy this app and have made multiple sales within the 5 days I\u2019ve had it! If you\u2019re wanting to sell that old vase that you\u2019re tired of looking at or even a car, I highly recommend letgo!! \ud83d\ude01</p>|I have sold quite a few items here after moving, but have never purchased anything.  Selling is pretty difficult and can take some time because of the many messages that you get from buyers that aren\u2019t serious.  The app is great...if only there were a way to hold prospective buyers accountable for sending \u201cI\u2019m interested\u201d messages. No matter how quickly you reply \u201cYes, when would you like to take a look?\u201d, many people will not even respond to that.  I understand that people change their minds, but if they see the photos, the price, dimensions, location, the fact that they must pick up in a certain location and all other pertinent information that they need to make their decision, how can they change their minds within minutes of a response?  I spend way too much time typing out responses letting prospective buyers know when I can meet them, exact location, etc...to hear absolutely nothing back.  That\u2019s the only frustrating thing about how this works.  Holding buyers accountable by having a system like Home Away would be great!  You already have the \u201cverified by\u201d icons.  Add another icon that shows their grade as a buyer and as a seller.  If the user does not respond to messages in their in box (quickly or at all), they are slowly downgraded.  Their grading will show up on their profile.  This will help others to decide if they want to reach out to them or not.</p>|Pros: It\u2019s a good app, pretty easy to browse local or long distance ads for people\u2019s stuff. Categories to narrow the search. The app predicts what you will like based on what you buy or look at most. It\u2019s easy to communicate through the app, and it gives safety advice like suggestions on where to meet when it sees you are planning a meeting. I usually give my cell number once we are meeting, but it\u2019s safest to keep it all on the app for record if possible. Selling on the app is a breeze and there seem to be a lot of active buyers in my mid sized college town..I imagine it\u2019s even better in metro areas or bigger cities. Most of my posts have gotten more response than a Craigslist ad ever got. They have Auto one button convo starters like \u201cIs it still available\u201d making it simple to shop. Free to buy and sell.Cons: The ads look deceivingly similar to posts sometimes so you accidentally get diverted to the web. Worst issue is that the way it\u2019s designed, you can\u2019t avoid accidentally sending the auto responses mentioned in the pros section. You will inadvertently send questions about things you were not interested in as you scroll through the app.  A lot of flakey sellers, and no guarantee on product quality. Overall it\u2019s a great app with just a few little flaws that are annoying at worst. But it\u2019s mostly just an open second hand market. It\u2019s a garage sale with pawn shop prices on a web platform basically.</p>", "four_star": "width: 16%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 68%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.4, 458.6K Ratings", "category": "Shopping", "sub_rank": "#2 in Shopping"}, {"size": "270.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/google-llc/id281956209?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Get started with Google Drive for free and have all your files within reach from any smartphone, tablet, or computer.

I needed something to replace iCloud. I love the fact there is no limitations when you upload. Just now I tried to open a video file to preview and somehow it showed a corrupted play button. My heart dropped and all I had to do was close the app and restart it. It worked fine. The only reason why I\u2019m using Google Drive is so that my files aren\u2019t ever going to get corrupt on me. Even if I send a copy to my camera roll I\u2019ll need it to show the exact date from when it\u2019s been uploaded or taken. Perfectly, the app does just that. I\u2019m happy to use Google Drive for all the files. Being a freelance photographer and cinematographer I\u2019d recommend this app to anyone. Please don\u2019t change anything within the app to make it difficult, or corrupt any of the files.Update: saving photo to camera roll doesn\u2019t show original date taken. It shows the day I save to camera roll. Uploads duplicates (sometimes), uploading a large amount of photos crashes the app, uploading shows the wrong number of uploads.Update: Saving a photo or video slightly decreases the resolution. We should be able to upload a photo or video with the resolution it was taken then saving it exactly how we upload it.</p>|I can easily check in with my students by creating \"shared\" folders. I have my own folders for each class hour I teach and each student has their own \"shared\" folder to me. Every assignment is to be done in this shared folder which I can access on my own screen and communicate via comments without standing over their shoulder. This gives accountability that students are on task and not hopping to a new browser, auto saves their work, folders can be shared/viewed by parents so parents know if their student is up to date with assignments, and gives me the luxury to have a paperless system-no more student claims of \"I turned it in!\".Clearly I like Docs as a result of teaching Langage Arts but we use slides, and students have their own websites by using \"sites\" which we use for facilitating student led conferences. This helps students be better prepared for future job interviews and practice presentation skills.The accessibility to view past versions of work is key to know when edits have been made to projects and lets students easily collaborate for group projects. I am SO GLAD our school has chosen to use Google Drive. I feel it's the best fit for both teachers and students to interact in this era that combines education and innovation.</p>|Say it\u2019s success is dependent upon server or is:   So google would make ya Believe they have one up on everybody else.

So far the game hasn\u2019t crashed or frozen.  (I\u2019m at level 295.) 2. Ads aren\u2019t as annoyingly long\u2014 as is the case with some games. 3. Ads offer variety \u2014 they aren\u2019t ALWAYS or MOST ALWAYS about how great it is to play a different game \u2014 then forcing the player to pretend-play it before returning to the original game. Minus: 1.  Game doesn\u2019t recognize some words [ex. lee - the side (of something, a building, a boat) that is sheltered from the wind]. 2. Stingy with \u201ccoins.\u201d [[ Okay, this is just my opinion. I\u2019m at level 295 - have 1,195 \u201ccoins.\u201d  A player earns coins when opening the game for the first time of day -a \u201cdaily\u201d prize - amount varies - 25 max as far as I can tell; 25 of these coins at the end of each 16-levels [game is designed to advance through theme-named steps - each with 16 levels in it] and by submitting \u201cextra\u201d words (not used in in crossword-style puzzle) - this is the one I think is \u201ccheap\u201d because a player gets only ONE coin for each extra word - and sometimes there are only few unused words that are even possible - I\u2019ve gone through several levels earning 0 coins!). [Might be more ways\u2014 I haven\u2019t fully explored the game\u2019s features \u2014 I don\u2019t bother with \u201ctournaments,  etc.]. When hints  \u201ccost\u201d 100 \u201ccoins\u201d I think allowing only 1 coin per extra word is stingy. And why not give a coin or two just for successfully finishing each of the 16 levels\u2014 just to allow for a FEW (at 100 coins each) hint purchases?  ]]</p>|I use to LOVE this game! I played frequently every day and looked forward to the weekend challenge to earn coins. I reached level 2464 and now I hate this game more than I can say in words here. I am so frustrated and angry because the game keeps freezing every few minutes. This has been an ongoing, continuous problem now for 4 weeks. It\u2019s blown any and every chance of winning the weekend tournament each week in addition to other coins for extra words which I always find many! I\u2019ve lost hundreds of coins due to the hanging and freezing and have potentially lost thousands! I contacted support immediately! Kenny takes time to reply and he never addressed specifically my problem loss of coins. He hasn\u2019t replied to my latest response to him in over a weeks! Unprofessional is the least of what this is. He had asked if I had the \u2018free\u2019 version with banners at the bottom. I downloaded the only version available in thee  App Store, and at the time I responded back to him, I saw no bottom banners because they, too, were hanging and not appearing. The loss of hundreds of coins, problem NOT fixed after 4 weeks, lack of timely reply to me, and no compensation for my troubles nor even addressing this AT ALL is why I give this game 1 star vs 5. I\u2019d give it a big fat zero if I could.</p>|Puzzles are decent. Adds are annoying, like any app.  After playing this for a few weeks, reaching level 800+, I\u2019ve noticed several times I enter a word that IS VALID, but the game won\u2019t accept it - even as a bonus word.  Yet, it will recognize odd words that are not common in the English language.  Can\u2019t recall any as an example, but when the word is clicked to see the definition, it is of foreign or ancient origin.  Nice to learn new words, but it should know every word combination possible from the letters provided. Hence, my 4 star review.  Should be 3.5 stars. Also, if you don\u2019t know the meaning of a word, don\u2019t make it the last word entered into the puzzle- Because, after the final word is entered, the screen clears and does not provide the player an opportunity to look up the meaning of the last word.   Here\u2019s a prime example.  Take the letters.  F H C I E Y L.    It doesn\u2019t know chiel, chyle, fiche ... ceil, elhi, fley, flic, fyce,heil, lech, lich, lief, lych, yech. ....... then there is TAU. 19th letter of Greek alphabet, is the first definition.   Right.....   now that I\u2019ve played for quite a length of time, I finally clicked the shopping cart, as I have over 21,000 coins.  Come to find out, can\u2019t purchase anything with just the coins.. need to spend real money too!  What a crock.  Should be able to buy a few in game help items using just the in game coins.</p>", "four_star": "width: 4%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 94%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.9, 321.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#2 in Word"}, {"size": "188.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/target/id297430073?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Whether you\u2019re shopping in store or at home, get trip planning, exclusive savings and more with the Target app. Plus, the new Wallet feature is the fastest, easiest way to save and pay in store.Plan your next Target Run by checking out the Weekly Ad, Cartwheel offers and item availability all in one place.

I price checked several items and they showed clearance price for the store that I am in, but when I go pay at the register they come out as regular price.  The cashiers and customer service reps say that they can\u2019t price match the price my app is giving me because it is a clearance item.  To which I say, \u201cit clearly states this is the price @ this store according to the app and store location.\u201d  But, nonetheless; they still say they can honor that price.  I try to buy item using my phone on the app and it doesn\u2019t let me add it to cart for the location of store that I\u2019m in, instead it gives me other locations with a different price value.  I don\u2019t get it!  It shows a clearance price for my store, the item is in stock but the price scans at the registers @ regular price.  I can\u2019t buy it online and choose my store because it doesn\u2019t give me that option, but does show availability @ other stores @ different price.  So in the end I cannot get the price it scans on my phone for my location and I cannot get it online for my store either, so why does it show item on clearance and available?</p>|I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a different Target app than this one, that people think is worth of five stars, but this one is terrible.  Trying to look for an item - it says they don\u2019t even carry it. I have to get to the items page by Googling it and letting Google take me into the Target app. If the item is not something they have store pickup turned on for fuhgeddaboudit - you pretty much have to drive store-to-store. Stores that show they have it, won\u2019t. And there\u2019s no option to ship it either.  Target needs to take several pages out of Best Buy\u2019s playbook and customers should be able to check inventory the same as an employee including stock counts.  Customers should also be able to see inventory for stores even if store pickup isn\u2019t turned on for an item (the item I\u2019m looking for I\u2019ve found at several stores but if you were going by the app or the Target website Target is leaving money on the table and a lot of it too).  Finally, any item that is in stock should be ship-able even if it\u2019s not in a customers immediate geography - retail stores shouldn\u2019t be storage lockers. If stores have it and customers want it in 2019 - there shouldn\u2019t be a disconnect on how to get product from store that has it to customer that wants it.

Each story I have ever read on episode wasn\u2019t a waste of time at all! All the stories were very detailed, also the storyline wants you to keep reading! The characters and quality is amazing, it brings life to the story! They feel like actual humans to me, how they move and what they wear, and their features. Though at first this game made me wait 3-4 hours for the tickets to refill which sucked! With this new update you can just watch ads to refill passes! So I don\u2019t have to wait for passes anymore! The gems are a problem that isn\u2019t really bad, but the gems is exaggerated amounts. First off in some stories you have to pay 20 gems for a outfit that won\u2019t last long at all, second I see you have to pay with gems after the next and the next, left and right, so I started reading what the community writers had to show. I think their stories are AMAZING! STORYLINE IS LITERALLY THE BEST! And I don\u2019t see me using my gems in sight, I haven\u2019t used my gems once from reading the community writers stories. So if you are planning to get this app for the first time, I recommend you read some stories with gems in them, then move over to The COMMUNITY WRITERS stories! This way you get a taste of both! After that I suggest you stick with THE COMMUNITY WRITERS STORIES! They are the best! But if you decide the ones with gems in the stories that\u2019s you, you do you!</p>|Episode is great, don\u2019t get me wrong. I honestly love it so much and I play episode almost every day. But the passes and gem situation is very frustrating. You have so many downloads, and you guys probably want to keep it that way. So if I were you, I would try putting yourself in a different position and ask, \u201cWould I be frustrated if I waited 4 hours to get 2 passes?\u201d I definitely would be. 2 measly passes after waiting for 4 hours! That\u2019s insane. Now I need to point out one thing though, they do give 4 passes every 4 hours of you continuously play episode. that seems a bit more reasonable. As I said I love episode, but maybe change it to 4 passes in 4 hours all the time, not just if u play episode a lot. Some people can be very inpatient and might just delete the app as soon as they see how long you need to wait. Also, maybe consider a thing where you can watch ads in order to get a pass?! please consider. One last thing. Some stories actually have tons of choices to choose! There\u2019s the rlly bad choice you have to choose, or the really good choice. But you don\u2019t really get to choose the one you want unless you have TONS of gems. And I mean TONS. Especially the pretty little liars. I honestly love it sm. But srsly? Almost 40 gems just to choose a good choice?! It makes me furious. Maybe have a limit for authors for about 10 gems per choice.</p>|I love the interactive stories this has to offer and their plots are intriguing as well. However it not only takes forever to get passes but the timer on it is glitchy. For example, just now I went back to the app around 6 o\u2019clock 6:30pm and it is currently 9pm. I used the rest of my four passes before 7 and it showed 3 and a half hours left but when I just checked it was telling me I still had to wait for 2 and a half hours instead of one and a half. That\u2019s an hours extra wait time. Players shouldn\u2019t have to use all four passes in order to reset the timer to earn more. It should be an hour or even half an hour for each pass with the option to watch ads (limited number per day) in order to earn more. Additionally players should be able to watch ads and earn gems, even if it\u2019s just two or three at a time because we want to be able to play the game fully. Also for whatever reason I feel super guilty when I don\u2019t do the premium option but that could just be my anxiety and lack of friends in the real world. Anyways the timer can be super glitchy and needs to be fixed as well as the opportunity to earn passes or just have a shorter waiting period. The pass timer being glitchy and awful has happened to me before on multiple occasions and I would like that to be fixed. The lack of ways to obtain extra passes and the unearned wait time really sets what otherwise is a really fun break, back two stars.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 81%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 1.2M Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#4 in Role Playing"}, {"size": "208.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/walmart/id338137230?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Our award-winning app saves you time and money.\u2022 Free shipping with no membership fee!

But a couple of the main things I liked have actually changed for the worse. First is the savings catcher. I\u2019ve been using it for years. Matches the sale prices at other stores and puts them on a digital Walmart card for you. You used to be able to scan your receipt. But now they will only do it if you used Walmart pay and paid through the app. And Walmart pay has its own issues. First it\u2019s slow and customers behind me in line tend to think I\u2019m just playing on my phone. Even some of the cashiers don\u2019t seem to understand. And sometimes I want cash back which doesn\u2019t seem to be an option on Walmart pay. Next is their 2 day shipping. Things used to show up in the promised 2 days. But the last two things I\u2019ve ordered have taken 4 days on one and 2 weeks on another. They are only counting actual transit time. NOT processing time! It\u2019s not 2 day until Fed Ex actually receives it from Walmart. And both my items were sold shipped by Walmart. And both said 2 day shipping. And both promised a delivery date in 2 days before I hit the pay button. Then magically the date changes to four days or beyond. Keep that in mind for gifts. If it\u2019s gonna take a week or so that\u2019s fine. Just be upfront about it.</p>|Okay like so many people I have been doing the savings catcher for years now. I typically will let it build up and then we I get around $30 or so I start look at the clearance camping supplies. I always joke with my wife that the savings rewards are my little bonus for how much she spends there. However this last little update has really ticked me off. I know a lot of people are upset about the auto gift card transfer.  I don\u2019t mind that but I am upset that for the past few days I\u2019ve been trying to transfer more into my gift card but every time I try it tells me oops sorry we are having trouble please try again later. I thought that it might just be the app. So I tried my laptop. When Safari didn\u2019t work I tried Firefox.  Then I wrote customer service and they said they were sorry but that I should access the site from google chrome. So I did that and it still doesn\u2019t work. When I try to click on the transfer to gift card it won\u2019t even acknowledge that option. I just wish that everything would be as smooth as it used to be.</p>|I have been using the Walmart app, primarily for the use of Savings Catcher, for many years now. While I didn\u2019t always get back tons of money, I always appreciated knowing that I was getting the best deal without shopping around while also being able to save my receipts digitally. I am incredibly disappointed in the recent move to linking receipt uploads ONLY through Walmart pay. I have chosen not to use Walmart Pay for personal and security reasons, not to mention that I also like to pay cash. This move (clearly to force users to use Walmart pay or miss out) disenfranchises so many users! There are many people who don\u2019t feel comfortable using that pay method, or that just need to manually upload for many reasons. I know that you have lost me for sure from your app, and possibly from shopping as often, as receipt uploads to savings catcher made me shop there more often. If I can\u2019t use Savings Catcher without being forced to use Walmart Pay, then this is no different than any other store... no more incentive to shop here. I genuinely want to use Savings Catcher and have the convenience of having receipts saved for me again. Bring manual uploads back and I\u2019ll begin shopping here more frequently again.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 81%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 780.8K Ratings", "category": "Shopping", "sub_rank": "#6 in Shopping"}, {"size": "639.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/atari/id291286181?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Create, customize and rule your theme park kingdom in RollerCoaster Tycoon\u00ae Touch\u2122.  \"Easily the best RollerCoaster Tycoon experience since RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 was released back in 2004.\" GAMEZEBOBuilding, customizing and sharing your coolest park creations in beautiful 3D graphics has never before been this fun or easy.

I\u2019m at level 15. Making money has been pretty easy, and there are numerous daily challenges that are easily attainable for $40k coins. It does take awhile to get the cards for more than the first rollercoaster, but I\u2019m entertained building up my other rides, adding scenery, improving the position of my utility services to better cover my rides, etc so it hasn\u2019t bothered me.There are several mini games that you can play once each in a set time interval. You can watch a short ad to run a promotion campaign, and the game isn\u2019t pushy about it. There are no BS pop up ads, or excessive ad watching like some games. There are enough other activities to make the game entertaining even when you\u2019re waiting to collect more coins for your next build. Sometimes there is a lull in activity, but leaving the game for a bit and coming back helps. I\u2019ve only really run into this after playing for quite some time.From the other reviews, it looks like the devs have improved many aspects of this game since release. I can say that I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn\u2019t a money grab kind of game, and isn\u2019t based around some stupid energy bar like so many others. I\u2019ve been able to actually PLAY without feeling like the game is impossible to enjoy without spending money.</p>|They fixed the heart issue I had and you can now earn as many as you like which is wonderful but now with the new update you can only earn tickets from one goal which is collect thirty hearts and that\u2019s it. The only other way you can collect tickets now is by the billboard or spinning the wheel. They took away earning tickets playing the arcade games as well. While I love this game we get the same cards all day long I\u2019m maxed out on so many cards yet I still get them. I get you are about making money but when you ruin a game you will lose your players all together. It would be great if we could get new land in our main parks I have so many rides I can not even place. I have been playing this game for a year almost and have accumulated eight thousand hearts which I found to be quite enjoyable it will take me forever to spend those just to earn a heart but of course I will. During the four hours between card packs I would play and play for hearts it was soooo much fun to me and it may not seem like fun for the developer but it was for me. I understand the new premise but I don\u2019t understand why change and cap it at all if it\u2019s truly unlimited I should be able to keep earning away. It\u2019s not like I play less I still play every four hours but now I just play a few minutes and come back in four hours. I still love your game which is why I am willing to up my stars to reflect my love for the game.</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 76%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 31.4K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#20 in Strategy"}, {"size": "130.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/amzn-mobile-llc/id297606954?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Stream movies and TV shows recommended for you, including Prime Originals like The Grand Tour, The Man in the High Castle, and award-winning kids series Tumble Leaf. \u2022 Customers with Prime can stream a vast library of movies and TV shows at no additional cost.\u2022 Customers in the U.S., UK, Germany, Austria, and Japan can watch videos purchased or rented at Amazon.

I am a crypto Movie addict so I watch everything Sasquatch, Bigfoot, Omaha or anything about the Big guy.  I would like to see more movies available on Prime to rent or even buy.  I have noticed that you have increased you bilingual movie with English subtitles which is frustrating.  I have a learning disability that limits the speed of my reading and by the time I read it, the scene has changed.  I would love the option to have a vocal reader for subtitles or I just turn it off and don\u2019t watch it.  It is extremely frustrating because I look forward to watching a series until I find out I have to read through it.       I am thankful to you for all your hard work and for providing a great variety of programming. Quality is excellent.</p>|I like the quality, features (on phone, your able to see the music that's playing during a spacific scene and all the main characters. Along with the seasons and episodes your currently on (if it's a TV show)), and I like the modern slick design. I don't appreciate the options (some movies you still have to buy or rent to enjoy) like 'The Grinch' among others for now. They have others available...that came out in 1920s but not the newer ones available!It has been frustrating that I have to watch on my phone for most of the features and am absolutely not able to watch anything on my laptop. I think it would be nice to have the same features available on Apple TV and so on. Lastly, it would be nice to be able to create multiple accounts for multiple people under 1 main account. Hope this helps! I look forward to seeing the changes in the future.</p>|I would say great, but I have a hard time finding videos I was just watching. I don\u2019t remember the exact show name and episode, so if it doesn\u2019t pop up, I have to search and search. That\u2019s kind of a nitpick item, since the show is there, and I will find it. This is very usable and very high quality for a phone video app. My other minor pet peeve is how it handles a series the second time I watch it. This only applies if you\u2019re weird like me, and you watch a series more than once. The second time through it might throw you to the last one second of episode 2, which keeps ending faster than you can pause it to swipe rewind. It can be comical at times. At other times, it throws you right to the critical scene, because you backed up to see it again last time, and that sort of takes some flavor off the episode. All minor issues, which could be solved with a \u201creset all episodes to start\u201d button. As it stands, I do it clunkily by hand when I decide to start a season over. No big deal. Oh, I would also love if new downloads would overwrite old ones when you max out, instead of making me go episode by episode through my downloads and delete them. Maybe a \u201cdelete all watched\u201d option to pop up when a new download is going to fail.

It\u2019s easy to switch between groups and I\u2019ve never had a problem with messages coming through or notifications. It\u2019s been wonderful! HOWEVER, I really wish members could comment on a post. Instead, important messages get lost in a sea of responses and different topics so every conversation is an endless cycle of scrolling. If I want to look back at what someone said a few days ago (like when and where to meet, for instance) I have to scroll through every single message (and \u201clol\u201d), instead of things being neatly nested so I can just scroll through topics. Other times, if other people start talking and I miss it I end up scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling back to see what on earth they\u2019re even talking about and honestly, by the time I find it I usually just don\u2019t even care anymore, I\u2019m so numb by the search for the one little comment that started the whole conversation. I\u2019ve tried using other apps because of this issue, but this app really is superior performance wise, except for this ONE thing. Developer Overlords, PLEASE, please let us thread comments so we can stop this endless scrolling!! I can\u2019t take it much longer! But nice job on the app overall. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019ve held out so long.</p>|Could y\u2019all make it so that we can see which group a person belongs to in the notifications area? Specially the lock screen? Currently, if a GroupMe notification alerts your device, you only see the person\u2019s name and not which group the person is from. It would be SOOO helpful, if I was able to see which group a person was chatting from without opening the app.For users involved in several groups with similar people, it\u2019s critical to know which group the notification came from ASAP. iMessage has this feature and it is a lifesaver when you need to respond quickly. It\u2019s like knowing it\u2019s a friend from \u2018hot yoga group\u2019 asking about the last minute location change and not someone in your \u2018biology study group\u2019 asking were class is. Imagine being in different groups with people who have the same name! It\u2019s so confusing when you read a message from John thinking it\u2019s John your work supervisor when it\u2019s really your best friend John sending you a picture of the roach he found in the bathtub. (Bc you cannot see pictures in the notifications which is another comment altogether). I still love this app! Best group messaging there is!</p>|This is a great app that I use every single day for a bunch of different group messages, but I feel like there are a few ways it could be improved to make it even more useful/ easier to use:Being able to view a picture from a notification without having to go into the app. It is very annoying to have to pull out my phone and go into the app to see the picture especially when I have an Apple Watch. It would be great to have an Apple Watch app to accommodate the iOS app. Along with being able to view a picture right from the notification this would be extremely useful with the new Apple Watch with cellular connectivity. Imagine if you are out going for a walk or run with just your Apple Watch Series 3 and someone sends you a picture. With the current system you would have to wait until you got home to view the picture. Another nice feature for the Apple Watch app would be the ability to see past messages instead of just the ones from notifications that go away when you tap on them. This would be just like how the messages app works on my Apple Watch.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 81%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 891.5K Ratings", "category": "Social Networking", "sub_rank": "#9 in Social Networking"}, {"size": "251.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/game-circus-llc/id366761192?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Get lucky with Coin Dozer: Casino!

Open the App. I have so far done Garden Scapes, SWHs Star Wars, and Angry Birds Evolution tutorials gem offers. Not one has paid. I did the open app for Bingo Party? Paid right away. I sent in a complaint about Star Wars, because I already love it, and spent money on it. I was incensed to see, that as well, hasn\u2019t paid. I have spent over $30 easy on it so far. I spent over $100 on a casino game to participate in my Club. I ended up deleting it, because of glitches as well. Please fix this. I don\u2019t want to delete you-Again.-</p>|Ok, at first, I really liked this game. The more I play it though, the more I notice the \u201cdistractions\u201d that take you away from the actual dozer game. You\u2019ve got the flip card game, you\u2019ve spinning the slot machine, you\u2019ve got opening the prize chests, you\u2019ve got opening the key chests, you\u2019ve got ad after ad after ad trying to get you to buy \u201cspot deals\u201d from the store. To the game writers: please, for the love of Pete, please stop yanking me out of the dozer game for these little sideshows! It\u2019s so annoying! I really just want to play the dozer part! I can see how many spins I have; you don\u2019t have to pull me to the slot machine every time I get a spin token. Same with the card game. Let me redeem them on my own time. And enough with the spot sales. Thank you!</p>|We really liked playing this game, when we could actually play. It was working fine at first but now it seems to freeze and crash all the time. Also it hasn't been paying out the coins for doing the \"extra offers\". I've done numerous surveys, which were completed, and i wasn't given the coins for them. Like thousands of coins. The first time I noticed, I emailed support. I received an auto email back saying that I need proof that I completed the offer. How do I get proof.?? So I started taking screenshots of the completed survey. There's several that I haven't been paid out for yet and the first email I sent over I STILL haven't had a response to! Super annoyed now and I will probably be deleting this app.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 12.2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#144 in Casino"}, {"size": "148.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/crazy-labs/id721307559?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Run run get around!Ever feel like you\u2019re just a little stickman caught up in the vicious circle of life?

It could be a blood rushing simple video game that gives you a great daily challenge. The only thing is, I just wish that they could take out the ads! I understand that you have to have to put in a couple ads because the app is free, but I just started this app, and I have very well discovered that every time you lose, it plays an ad. On some levels, you can watch ads to continue, and if you say no, it plays an ad anyway. What\u2019s the point? You might as well just watch a hundred ads and it still wouldn\u2019t add up to this game. A great way to make more money is to have a store, in which you can buy tools to help you win. That would be a great deal, and hopefully, for a great cost. Another idea is, after someone uses up about 10 revivals, they will have to watch an ad after that. You should be able to buy more shapes, other than a circle to run around in, and you should be able to buy or watch an ad for more background colors. I just hate when they don\u2019t give you a choice to watch an ad, because many people HATE watching ads! There are so many possible things to make this app more colorful, so why can\u2019t you just offer that and get more money, without making unwilling people watch ads.        I will be subtracting one star until this problem is solved.</p>|I love this game but I just downloaded it and I got to lvl. 31 and today it just deleted all my lvls !!!!!!!!! And the game isn\u2019t centered on my screen. So when I go to the different people I only see the right half of the choices! Please fix this I would have given this game a 5 stars if it weren\u2019t for this. \ud83e\udd84I love the unicorn skin!! \ud83e\udd84 The game works except for the fact that it deleted all my lvls and skins and it isint in the middle of my screen.      I also think that this game could have a thing that if you can\u2019t go around the circle \u2b55\ufe0f you can click it to skip the lvl.                                                                                                    So in conclusion Please fix the of Center screen on my game and the deleting of my data.LATER RESPONSE AFTER FiXINGSo I didn't youse the app for a few days and updated my IPad (turns out it was out of storage) and when i did that it wanted me to update the app so I did then it fixed itself but it took a day to load (but that\u2019s not the developer\u2019s foult its cuz i have bad WiFi)</p>|This game is very fun and addicting. I love the different skins you can use as a little stickman or woman. There\u2019s also a good variety of levels as you move forward, some of them really have my heart pumping. However, I completed all the levels already, so they definitely need more. The levels like I said have variety but honestly they need something a little extra in the next update. The only other con is that they ADS ARE SO ANNOYING. Way too many. You can watch one to get a revival if you lose and want a second chance, which is reasonable, but it\u2019s like 30 seconds long. What\u2019s more annoying is when you lose a couple times and don\u2019t even hit the second chance button, it STILL shows you an ad. Granted, it\u2019s like 5 seconds till you can hit the X to get rid of it so it\u2019s short, it\u2019s still obnoxious and happens too much. I\u2019ve actually exited the game before cause I was so tired of the ads. If they just fix those things this game would be a constant and everyday thing for me.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 79%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.6, 22.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "N/A"}, {"size": "138.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/zephyrmobile/id1305183034?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "# Get COOL Live Wallpapers for your iPhone.

I downloaded the app to see what it was all about. I took the 3-day trial and  downloaded a number of images. Using their instructions, I installed one of the Live Photo\u2019s on the Lock Screen of my iPhone 7 Plus. As I did this I discovered that using Live Photos as wallpaper is actually a feature of the iPhone 6 and newer. I didn\u2019t need an app to install them which is what I thought Live Wallpapers Now was designed to do. You don\u2019t need the app to install a Live Photo on your lock screen. What Live Wallpapers Now does do is give you access to a library of live photos which you can download to your photo library. The images range from abstract, animals, nature, florals, science, sunsets, underwater scenes. Some are stunning with time-lapsed frames others pan across scenery or catch movement with animals. It also appears like you can upload your best Live Photo\u2019s to their library. Which leads me to the point that, if you are a decent iPhone Live picture photographer, you can use your own photos. However the issue which I must caution you is that continued access after the 3-day trail to the premium content also comes at a premium price of $7.99/month which you are AUTOMATICALLY SUBSCRIBED TO! Personally, I wasn\u2019t interested, nor would I even change my lock screen often enough to warrant paying such a price!  I made sure my subscription was cancelled immediately.</p>|I downloaded to check it out.  They immediately ask you to sign up for a description.  I click NO THANKS.  Then I get hit with ad (no big deal, They said there would be ads with free account).  Then I swipe to see next wallpaper.  Guess what?  Another ad.  Then I swipe for another... yup... another ad.  I went to close the ad and instead it opened up into iTunes for me to download the ad app (although I know I clicked the X to close).  I go back to the app, and the same ad app pops up.  I try to close, and it goes to iTubes (again).  I force quit for app, start it back up, and it again asks me if I want a subscription or try for free.  I choose free (again), but then it takes me to iTunes to buy.  I exit iTunes and and I click NO THANKS again, and it (again) takes me to iTunes to buy.  I try one more time, and as you expect... iTunes.  The NO THANKS link is at the bottom.  The 2 Buy buttons are at the top and middle.  It\u2019s not difficult to hit the NO THANKS link and I can see it change colors when I select it, but the link goes to the store instead.  They obviously programmed it this way, hoping someone would just pay the $2 so they can check out the app more.  I would have been happy to pay for the app or even sign up for a subscription, but I was never able to actual try the app.  Plus, I can\u2019t support a developer who deliberately tries to trick their users.  You can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, trust such a developer.</p>|I only used the app for a minute so far and every single action I took except for saving the first wallpaper in the carousel triggered the subscription screen. And the close button doesn\u2019t appear for a couple seconds, which is a very bad practice and inconsiderate to users. And since I wasn\u2019t able to tap on any of the wallpaper images in the carousel, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not possible to download any other wallpaper than the first one unless I subscribe.Overall, the app doesn\u2019t give the user a chance to explore a little bit before deciding whether to subscribe or not. Why would I invest in something before having an idea of the value I will get out of it? Especially if my initial interaction is frustrating... Also, why would I pay $7.99 per week to download wallpapers?  I would understand having in-app purchases like $0.99 for 3 wallpapers, but recurring payments is unnecessary and a bit insane in my opinion. How many wallpapers do I need to download and and use to get my money\u2019s worth from the app? I also found the intro screens weird and unnecessary. The fact that how to set a wallpaper was explained to me as soon as I opened the app made me wonder whether this app has a different and hard way to set wallpapers. Everyone knows how to set a wallpaper. And if someone doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to worry about it until after they choose and download one.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 75%;", "one_star": "width: 8%;", "star": "4.4, 191.7K Ratings", "category": "Lifestyle", "sub_rank": "#16 in Lifestyle"}, {"size": "287.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/peak-games/id476160947?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "WELCOME TO THE FUNNIEST CARTOON PUZZLE ADVENTURE!From the creators of Toy Blast comes the ultimate puzzle game with unique gameplay and endless fun!Enter the crazy cartoon world starring Cooper Cat, Wally Wolf, Bruno Bear and enjoy loads of whacky and challenging levels!

There is no real point to this game, besides the reason that they just burst bubbles, crates, and blocks. They also rescue the ducks, which is a skinned version of any of the other game\u2019s toys are animals. Please do realize that a lot of people really know this is true. Delete this game, please. All of those 5 star reviews should be fake unless this is the first type of game they have encountered. As so as the money problem in this game. I have seen that people have been spending quite a bit in this game to make it more possible and \u201cfun\u201d for them to get through a level. But, indeed, I played until level 102 or so. This was the check out all the same features it has like any other game like this. To add on, people who think this is not a cliche, I am sure that this game was created after the original ones, which I do not play since it is not my type of game. It\u2019s rather how many ads are on this game and how stupid it is to think that people have played this when there is the original, but still fun, games using this layout as well. If you play this game, I understand that you may like it, but I just want to put a warning for the people who may agree. I give this game a strait on fail in creativity and a half fail on fun. Thanks for reading and I hope it gives you a point.</p>|I\u2019ve played this game not long after it became available. I\u2019m at the top tier plus play through the \u201c champion \u201c levels until another 50 levels are added then play on. I\u2019ve watched every facet: how the block falls sequence, how the buttons for purchase items are placed....on and on. Yes, the game programmed in a way that will exhaust your resources and the mat layout positioned to make you accidentally spend gold.  The common misconception is to expect anything less. The developers and publishers analysis players and construct to maximize profits. It\u2019s no different than slots. The problem is there is no regulatory or oversight commission to protect the player. So other than common sense, we are at the mercy of a new group:Game Publishers. The game developer arena is saturated and highly competitive with the goal to make a product people like...same as always. The publisher takes the product and maximizes the profit potential. This a cold group with the old  \u201crobber baron\u201d intent. Until something intercedes, players are at their mercy and they have none. So, play with caution and common sense. It\u2019s difficult to show restraint when your set up at every turn but that\u2019s life. I\u2019m an old man and like the saying goes, \u201cseen it and been there\u201d....over and over again.</p>|I used to really enjoy this game and played whenever I was bored or had a few minutes to kill. I was all the way to the Championship rounds (once you beat the boards developed, you replay some of the more difficult boards in order to continue helping your team and still play the game) however, the new updates created more glitches in the game and the developers have done nothing to fix them. The one most talked about on my team was the \u201cstar chest\u201d rewards. Once you collect 20 stars, you open a chest and, depending on how many lives you have, you get hearts/lives. Well, I received on 2 separate occasions hearts from my chest that were not added to my lives. I wrote both times to support and was advised that 1.) because of the new update, the hearts go to the stash box (which I knew however they didn\u2019t\u2014hence my concern) and 2.) I was mistaken and it wasn\u2019t hearts I received (which it was but there is a glitch...) so I would not be getting any. I played this game multiple times a day and sometimes paid for extra items and coins but after the second glitch and response from the developer, I decided to keep my money and time and promptly deleted this game and my stats. I will never support this developer and I suggest you all save your money and time as well.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 80%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 1.1M Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#21 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "160.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/groupon-inc/id350020099?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Download Groupon and save up to 70% on the things you need every day.

You cannot Beat the prices! I will never go back to the \u201cupscale salons\u201d I used to spend my hard earned money on. Every Groupon I\u2019ve bought for cut and highlights has been a wonderful experience at salons that, in my opinion did a better job than the salon I was a regular patron at and paid twice the money!!!! Also, I have bought several Groupons for Botox and have ALWAYS been pleased with the results! I once saw a survey where people were asked \u201cWould you Ever buy a Groupon for Botox?\u201d Most people said \u201cno\u201d. What I would say to these people is that Groupon\u2019s Site offers the Best services and most businesses use Groupon to promote their business due to heavy competition. They want you to be 100 percent satisfied with their services because they are hoping to gain new clients. The Botox I received at all three Business\u2019s from Groupon was Amazing! I was treated with genuine kindness and professionalism which made me want tome come back to them in the future plus I had no side effects from the botox like bruising or drooping. I did have those kind of outcomes at top medical offices that I paid very high prices for who are not affiliated with Groupon. Thank you Groupon for giving the consumer excellent choices of businesses to choose from.</p>|Me and my husband have used Groupon on and off for about 3 years but we recently started relying on Groupon for the last year after getting married ...... if we take a trip first place we check is Groupon...you offer ridiculously unbelievable prices. in our most recent trip we wanted to stay an extra day and asked what the charge would be. The same amount we payed for the 3 days is what one extra day would cost! need something that we can\u2019t really find?.....GROUPON has it. The variation of the same thing is what I like as well...... I\u2019m the type of woman who loves a certain item and needs it in absolutely every color. The only thing that I,as a customer, found  a little difficult is that when you do book a trip and you accidentally made an error you cannot go back and change it..... our fault but I believe that if you are able to catch it right then and there you should be able to fix it. None the less, THANK YOU Groupon you guys are the best!!! Thanks for making trips actually happen for me and my husband. Growing up sheltered, it\u2019s nice to finally be able to do it not only because I\u2019m married but because of your amazing deals! Being financially savvy is the way to enjoy vacations and get aways! I can\u2019t thank you guys enough!</p>|Though I do enjoy Groupon and have spent thousands over the years with Groupon, they are in need of improvement. One issue I have is returning a Groupon. It is ridiculously inconvenient and beyond frustrating to try to return or exchange a Groupon. Instead of getting Groupon bucks, which seems to be a more logical and fair thing to do, Groupon only allows you to purchase another Groupon in only a certain area, i.e. \u201ca local deal\u201d, etc. and within a short period of time. It is a complicated system and I lose more money through Groupon, and I am beginning to expect it was designed that way. People do not want to deal with such hassle so I assume most people would simply forget about it. Which I have done in the past because I don\u2019t feel like dealing with only 24 hours to search for local deals. Not only that, but most local deals in my area are the same old thing that we always see advertised in a Groupon. Little variation.

So here it is again! Nothing has changed. Still haven't received a mystery box. Still like the game though. Follow up - 4 months have gone by and I still haven't received the mystery box!  A couple of months ago I purchased the bundle for $6.99. Not only did I not receive a mystery box, which I understand has happened to many who have purchased this bundle, but I received less than the correct number of gold bars. Do you think anyone responded to my issue after contacting the app developer?  Nope!  Don't waste your money on purchasing anything from them.  Their pockets are getting heavier.  If I could rate this game a minus zero, I would - just because of their non response!  Well a month has gone by and I still haven't received my mystery box.  What a shame! 2018 and I still like the game. However, I am still waiting for that mystery box! So, months have continued to pass by. Lol, loving the game. It has become more interesting over the years. PS - still waiting for the mystery box.........a few days have passed by since my last review. I still like the game, but doggone it I wish I would receive that mystery box! Lol. Waiting patiently..............</p>|Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love this game. But it has its flaws. When you fail a level, normally you can see that you only need one simple move to pass it. It gives me the option for 5 more moves, but you have to buy it with \u201cgold bars\u201d. Like, who wants \u201cgold bars\u201d? You spend way too much money to BUY them, so no, I\u2019m not using gold bars. I don\u2019t even know how you earn them! I got 5 for downloading the app, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever received. You would think they would have a solution if you went to the help center, but no. I get that they have to gather money somehow, but they would get far more if they didn\u2019t charge $3 a pop. More people would buy, more money. But it also makes no sense to put in your credit card number and spend all your sweet time to buy a 10 pack of gold bars for $3.00. It will also give you and option to \u201cspin the wheel\u201d. No one EVER gets the jackpot, because it\u2019s rigged. Like, why would you even put the jackpot on there if no one can get it?! Plus it gives you an option to spin and win a \u201cbooster\u201d. Like why would you want a booster if your out of moves and can\u2019t use it to pass your level?! They could at least give you one more move to burst that one jelly cube you have left. Other that the above, this game is totally awesome!</p>", "four_star": "width: 22%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 72%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.6, 646.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#10 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "107.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 7%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/cheetah-technology-corporation-limited/id949821679?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Bricks n Balls is a classic and exciting brick game.

You\u2019re endlessly hit with ads. I have no idea what the daily freebie plays you earn everyday do and there is absolutely no explanation available anywhere in the app or even online - I checked. There is a star bar but you never seem to accumulate rubies when you pass the level - is this a bug?  Some levels are truly impossible to pass without using rubies (or the mystery elements, whatever they do) and the rubies are too hard to come by. You could opt to watch even MORE ads to earn 150 rubies a day, but I came to play a game not pound myself with commercials during my game time. I bet if you actually won rubies by passing levels, as the layout suggests you\u2019re supposed to, this game would be much more fun. I have played every day for a month; you\u2019d think I could have saved up for one custom ball by now, but no. I have never accumulated more than 500 rubies because it costs 200 to continue on a level the first time and 300 the second. If you have to use rubies to pass levels, you\u2019ll never get to the 1000 needed to buy a different ball.  All of this means it\u2019s now getting boring to play and the frustrations have added up to make me deem this app unplayable. Too bad.</p>|On its surface, this is a fun little game that I could see myself losing hours just getting absorbed into this. But in actuality, I only play it for small bursts. Why? The ads. I understand they need to make money, and the ads pay for it, but when you get one for whatever you do, some of them being 30 seconds long and unskippable, it's annoying fast. Failed a board? See an ad. Go to the home menu? See an ad.This alone would be annoying, but add in broken mechanics, and it reaches a whole new level. I didn't hit a major wall until around level 120, at which point, you find yourself needing about 500 gems just to clear the board. (Too many low blocks with high values, and nothing to ricochet the balls off of.) Add to this, the boards themselves are very stingy at giving credit toward the 50 (or 100) gem thresholds. 100-Ball seems to be the best place to grow the bar (since it has a fast ad delivery system), but more often than not, if I hit replay, the ball starts out-of-bounds, meaning you hit no blocks, no points, but you will get another ad. There is no reason to start the ball there- this is clearly a design flaw.If it weren't for the flaws, I'd consider buying the no-ad add-on, but as things are now, I can't in good conscious recommend paying any money toward this.</p>|It\u2019s over all a great idea, but- I\u2019m constantly hit with adds\ud83d\ude29, and there seems to be multiple bugs in the game. I would have loved \u2764\ufe0fto continue playing this game, but , well, when I go to play a game, I\u2019m not looking for a game that constantly pops up with adds. Especially when the adds go on and on , and there are 30 second ones more frequently then with other apps. Lots of adds usually have a little \u201c x \u201c at the top to tap out, but with these ones, you have watch the whole thing!!!!\ud83d\ude22 I would love to continue playing this game, as soon as the adds pop up less frequently. And yes , your saying:\u201d why don\u2019t you just pay to not have adds\u201d well, I don\u2019t want to have to pay , if I can just go play something else, because there are many other games like this, which is another reason... I don\u2019t know who came up with this idea for a game, but there seems to be so many games like this , such as ballz ect... it\u2019s kind of annoying!!     I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my phone , or what, but it\u2019s also kind of hard to move the dotted line ( the thing to aim)  it\u2019s so fidgety! It also sometimes gets on my nerves... Maybe it\u2019s just me , but , I love the other games ( ballz...) so much more. I really recommend those ones.

I thought that there was no possible way I could sound like a celebrity. Now, this technology is nowhere near perfect, but it does actually work. The trick is you need to be in a quiet room. I also noticed it works much better on newer iPhones than old ones. So make sure you have the latest operating system. It refers to some kind of old cartoon version on older operating systems. You also have to be the only one talking. When I tried using it with music in the background it sounded absolutely horrible. Like a robot being tortured. The next time I tried the application it worked perfectly, with no robotics sound. It\u2019s also important to note that the application can\u2019t get sounds, like laughing for example. Hopefully the developer can update this in a subsequent version? After I figured out how to use the app, I was able to create a bunch of hilarious videos. So basically, don\u2019t expect the world from this application, but also make sure use it properly and as intended. The technology is not quite good enough to work all of the time, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. I think the potential is there for this technology to become mainstream. Maybe even the voice of connected home devices, or my next car GPS\u2026 Only time will tell. In the meantime, developer, can you please add the voice of PewDiePie?</p>|When I downloaded this app, I was very excited as it seemed like the perfect app to have fun with friends with. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It has issues, at least for me, with picking up your voice when you speak into it. If this weren\u2019t already bad enough, when your voice has been changed, there are obvious, long pauses between each word making it very unrealistic and not worth your time, unless you are using it with children as many children would be thoroughly entertained by this app regardless of these pauses. Also, when you download the app, you must download a free trial and after this you must pay $9.99 each week to use it. Unfortunately for me, when you sign up for the free trial it subscribes you to it and will automatically charge you $9.99 each week, regardless of whether or not you still have the app downloaded on your phone, so if you delete the app, make sure to cancel the subscription in your settings! Luckily, Apple support was very helpful in getting me a refund on this as I did not realize I was subscribed. However, I do not appreciate that I was put through all this trouble. Overall, I feel that this app is very misleading and lackluster, but I am very happy that I was able to get a full refund on the charge for my subscription and I would recommend the app if you have children!</p>|Amazing app if you understand how to use it you can make the clips sound pretty freakin realistic.. talk in a moderate and clear voice and you can avoid the robo dialer sound. With this said having to wait a whole minute for 6 second clip isn\u2019t all that bad considering you can save the clip. I would like to see that if these are being post to public like show in that check box that you can see what other people have done, but you can really only save, share or replay. Now, yes. There is a 3 day trial which I am currently using which extends the clips to 15 seconds, but the app hopes to charge $10 dollars a week concluding that trial!? No thanks.. given the amount it crashes or can\u2019t understand a clip I record, the fact there aren\u2019t any additional features or voices that you can access from the subscription cost I\u2019m giving it a very generous rating. With that said the level of app uniqueness calls for such.. really it is worth a try, but the limited number of voices and it not having some sort of community access for the clips makes the VERY unsettling $40 dollars a month a major pass for me. All and all make what you will of them, but it is a pretty incredible piece of software and worth a try.</p>", "four_star": "width: 6%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 69%;", "one_star": "width: 17%;", "star": "4.1, 53.3K Ratings", "category": "Entertainment", "sub_rank": "#43 in Entertainment"}, {"size": "185.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ebay-inc/id282614219?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Buy, sell, and save with eBay.

I\u2019ve been using the eBay app for many years and it\u2019s time to make major upgrades as far as searching goes. For example, when you refine your searches you should be able to put options for the seller. Separate companies from legit normal sellers/people. First off, I hate looking at generic stock images of companies selling stuff. Especially when it comes to clothing or car parts. I would rather buy from an actual human with actual pictures of the items. Not companies with 20K or 100K in feedback that can\u2019t even answer your questions or make sure your item is shipped accordingly. They are very unorganized because of traffic. eBay shouldn\u2019t be for companies. Also, there should be an option to choose sellers with 100% positive feedback. Or no more than 3 negative reviews. I don\u2019t want sellers with 10 or more negative reviews. It\u2019s a preference because why would I want someone that hasn\u2019t learned or doesn\u2019t take pride in selling. It\u2019s really not that hard to keep your feedback at 100%. I\u2019m a buying/seller and everybody I\u2019ve dealt with has been really legit simply because I keep it with the trusted ones. But it\u2019s hell when you have to search for hours in order to find these people. I have it a three because other than that it\u2019s fine but this has been a huge hurdle. I\u2019m surprise no one else has thought of changing this.</p>|The main problems that I have experienced have to do with fake accounts or sellers backing out on deals. I have bought items from sellers on multiple occasions and did not receive the item. I have been told that the seller has lost the item on their transport truck, while this seller only sells a few items per month and obviously does not have a huge business that requires a transport vehicle (they listed it for less than they thought). I have been told that a sellers account must have been compromised by a third party making prices too cheap.... etc.. It comes down to poor listing and lying after you realize that you listed something too cheap. This is not the buyers responsibility or problem, if I buy and pay for an item, we are both entering a binding contract to do business. I\u2019m sorry that you may have made a mistake but a deal is a deal so stand by it and don\u2019t make the same mistake again. As a seller, I have encountered  similar issues. I have made mistakes in a listing as well. I knew that it was my mistake and I should have caught it, the item sold at a cheap price, I shipped it out with a smile. It\u2019s the same as a handshake to me but apparently not to Ebay customer service because they side with them every time. As a seller, make sure your buyer restrictions are set to on!</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 86%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 1M Ratings", "category": "Shopping", "sub_rank": "#7 in Shopping"}, {"size": "154.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bird-rides-inc/id1260842310?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Bird gives you access to shared personal electric vehicles (scooters) that can be picked up and dropped off anywhere.

However, as a charger I found a couple issues I\u2019d like to address. 1. Chargers need to be given more chargers or need to be able to access additional chargers quickly because I just hate seeing the missed green marks on my map at the end of the night. Maybe more birds will get charged, less will go missing, and there will be a better report of the amount of damages birds as an effect. 2. Get rid of red and yellow charging bubbles. These seem to me to be fool\u2019s gold and  they encourage \u201cransoming\u201d birds in private property. Even if one is to happen upon a unicorn bird aka $10 or higher the price is immediately cut when alarmed or proven that it\u2019s secretly being held hostage for more money. Don\u2019t get me wrong charging birds is freaking great; it\u2019s an actual fun job and I love how simple it is\u2014these problems being solved would just make the whole operation a lot smoother I think. I would definitely recommend it as a part-time / summer job. I like the nest placements because they\u2019re everywhere and that the scooters are unlock-able after capture as it makes for much easier transportation.</p>|This is a review from a chargers perspective. If your downloading this app to become a charger you may want to hold off for the next few updates. Being a charger seems great until you find out how confusing and frustrating it is. You guys at bird need to hire more user experience IT guys because the app is seriously lacking on the charger side. You guys need to clear all of the red scooters off of the map. Its a terrible idea and makes things more confusing for the chargers. If you guys need help locating lost or damaged scooters you should hire a more dedicated team to do so. All these red scooters are cluttering the map! Most them should at least should drop off from the map after a few days of not being found. The same goes for the yellow scooters. You guys should aim to make charging as simple as possible! It shouldn\u2019t be a scavenger hunt to find a scooter you want to charge. You guys are seriously wasting peoples time and gas by having these miscellaneous birds that are not even at the location. If someones says the bird is not there it needs to be removed from the map (period). Or hire a dedicated person to go around and check if the birds are really even there. Something seriously need to change if you want to see a better turn out for charging these scooter. Others wise you have people out here wasting precious time.</p>|I really love BIRD\u2019s viewpoint of getting cars off the road However, from a business stand point - and my personal experience as a BIRD Charger -  I honestly believe it would benefit BIRD to invest in stronger and more timely tech support ( it could take up to 24 hours to get a reply) - rather than investing in expansion to other cities, states and countries. I feel like it is a House of Cards and I would hate to see such a great idea crumble...My first several weeks as a Charger were great. Even though I only had 3 charger cables, with the proper planning and the will to hustle, on a good day I was able to charge 14-18 scooters. Around the beginning of August - my BIRD app would no longer allow me to \u201ccapture\u201d birds. The app would vibrate when I scanned an AVAILABLE bird - but the scanned bird would not show up in my ACTIVITY TASKS. On numerous occasions, I reached out for tech support. They suggested I update the app, delete my app, change my email address, etc. None of these simple suggestions worked.  After 3 weeks, and hours and hours of trying to get the app back to working mode - I\u2019m still unable to \u201ccapture\u201d. Apparently no one is trained or qualified to help beyond the obvious. So, quickly the Bird App went from a viable form of income to a complete waste of time. So disappointing...</p>", "four_star": "width: 3%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 94%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.9, 435.9K Ratings", "category": "Travel", "sub_rank": "#10 in Travel"}, {"size": "140.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/voodoo/id714804730?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Swipe your finger to guide a snake of balls and break the bricks.Try to break as many bricks as possible.Get additional balls and make the biggest snake ever!Very easy to play but very hard to reach high scores!Game Features:- Free to play- Endless gameplay- Simple swipe control- Challenge your friends with the best highscore</p>", "subtitle": "A classic game, revisited", "title": "Snake VS Block", "similar": "  Six!\n,  Scale\n,  Looper!\n,  Twisty Arrow!\n,  Draw In\u2122\n,  Slices\n", "two_star": "width: 2%;", "price": "Infrequent/Mild Horror/Fear Themes", "inapp_purchase": "$2.99,$0.99", "autor": "Voodoo", "reviews": "|It didn't take long for me to become addicted to this game - extremely fun and a great pass time! The levels are constantly changing so you have a new experience every time, so it keeps you on your toes. Regarding the ads, I'm used to very ad-heavy games, so they tend not to bother me too much (unless I'm doing the challenges and am so bad I die every half second).However, I have to admit two things bother me. While the ads are not a huge problem for me, they'll begin to lag up my game while playing. This will really screw up my reaction time and have led to a handful of untimely deaths. In addition, while the design of randomized block numbers keeps the game fresh and continuously re-playable, sometimes the omnipotent RNGesus is not kind to me and it will give an entire row of blocks far too great for me to get past, even if I had collected every extra ball beforehand. Perhaps tweaking the algorithm will help prevent that; I have no clue how any of that works but just a suggestion.Overall, I really love this game and recommend it to anyone who has the free time to play an app or two!! If you lightened the ads to regulate its frame rate as well as making sure that the game's randomized numbers don't stack against the player's favor, I would have zero complaints!</p>|If you\u2019re like me, you got bombarded with ads for this game. I downloaded it with low expectations that weren\u2019t met.Now, this is a Ketchapp game, so it goes without saying that there were an abundance of ads that play every time your character dies. I understand that ads are needed to make money but the ads pop up just where you are trying to tap to retry, and I often tap on them by accident, opening up a whole new window.Now to talk about the gameplay. The concept itself doesn\u2019t seem that bad. But once you start playing, you find many flaws. Since you can\u2019t see more than about three blocks ahead of you at any given time, it is often pure luck if you can find a block small enough to break. There are also some blocks with stars that make you invincible for a few seconds, but what happens when you hit them drives me insane. It causes my phone to start buzzing in my hands for no apparent reason, and I don\u2019t need my phone vibrating WHILE I\u2019M PLAYING A GAME.The title of this review is \u201coverrated because that\u2019s exactly what it is. There are millions of downloads and many people seemed to love it. I think most of them are predisposed to like any Ketchapp game given enough constant advertising, but personally, I just find it really annoying.</p>|The addition of 50 challenges was a good idea to break the monotonous single game mode and add some variety, however it was done so in such a poor way that it makes you want to stick to the original game mode. There are no rewards for completing any of the challenges (yet to see if there is a reward for completing all 50) and the later challenger are just more difficult re-skins of previous ones. Theres pretty much only 5 or 6 challenges bumped up at 10 difficulty levels so as to avoid making new and original content. Some of the challenges are entirely luck based as you need to go 300 meters in 30 seconds. This sounds like a nice, skill based challenge, but don't let it deceive you. You winning or losing is entirely dependent on weather the game spawns [1] squares or [2] - [6]  squares because the amount of time it takes to break those [2] - [6] squares makes it impossible to finish. You have to hope you get all [1] squares or all but one or else you get to 295 meters at 30 seconds. This isnt skill this is luck. Make set levels and spawns for every challenge so you guys know its beatable every time.

It\u2019s my way of winding down. But now, instead of just running short, minor ads in between games, there is also a banner that runs at the top while you play. Sometimes they\u2019re animated and distracting. I wish it only had the ads in between games. I really dont like the banner, but I get it if you guys need the money. Also There is now a shuffle/hint option at the bottom of the screen. These are cool features, but I wish there was a way to hide that bottom bar while I play the game (kind of like the how you make the toolbar hide, when not in use, on Macs or Windows). I find the bubbles on the \u201chints\u201d and \u201cshuffles\u201d remaining to also be distracting. That\u2019s a symptom of living in this modern era of push notifications. I hate those bubbles with numbers in them and I\u2019m the sort of person to clear them as soon as they present. Earlier update was a solid 5 stars. These updates make me give it a 4 now.</p>|UPDATE: May 2018: upgraded from 2 to 4 starsSignificant improvements since 2017, Most important being reduction in ads impeding play of the game, and improved flow of the actual play.You no longer have to wait a significant period of time and endure a number of obnoxiously loud ads before playing a new game.  The win percentage has also increased, Further reducing the percentage of time waiting for ads as opposed to playing the game. The features of this ap are better than other solitaire games are making this a recommendation at this time.If there is a return to a system that appears tvmanipulated to force you into an artificially high number of ad plays, I will delete this ap and downgrade to 1 star.2017 REVIEWADS:  I have found that my percentage of wins is higher using a standard deck of cards, which to me is suspicious, since when you lose you have to endure another ad before playing another game.  That is in addition to the banner ads which can be clicked accidentally.  Given how short the actual game is, the percentage of time watching ads is unacceptable, making the game more frustration than fun.TECHNICAL:  for the above reasons I have Limited playtime, but I have not had any technical difficulties with the app.</p>|One of the reviews said he played this game to get points for another game and after playing 100 games he couldn\u2019t even win one. I don\u2019t know what level he\u2019s playing but I just played this game. Single card and I beat the first game thinking it was going to be hard. It was the easiest game ever and I played a few more just in case and still won.  I don\u2019t know if maybe they think they know how to play solitaire or was just wanting to write a bad review but it\u2019s not that hard and I didn\u2019t even need the undo button. You don\u2019t need all the cards on a like from King to Ace. Start putting some cards on the top of the screen.

Blowing up planets with rockets, basic and the ones you can unlock further into the game. But the game feels entirely unfinished. There are only 5 upgrades, \u201cpower\u201d, \u201cspawn rate\u201d, \u201cgravity\u201d \u201caccuracy on tap\u201d and \u201coffline earnings\u201d. Offline earnings is a joke, so i can hardly consider this an idle game. You close the app for 30 minutes and you\u2019d get the same amount of money that you would if you left the game closed for 24 hours. There is no money upgrade. From planet 1, all rockets that hit the planet give you 5 points all the way until planet 100, which is the final planet. After you finish planet 100, you get a \u201cprestige\u201d reward which is just a bombing thing that stays on constantly, giving you maybe 20 points per hit which is still useless considering when you get all the upgrades to level 50 they cost about 5000 per upgrade. Most of these idle games are cash grabs and we all know that, but this one goes overboard.</p>|This game is fun for 10-15 minutes at a time. There are 18 weapons you have to destroy the planets (unlocked slowly one at a time as you level up) you only have access to 11 of them unless you pay a monthly membership to the game. Almost half the weapons and every single \u201cbooster\u201d is locked behind a pay wall. Not \u201cwatch an ad to get\u201d but a real money pay wall. The game is okay but no where near good enough to pay for. There are ads on every level whether you choose to watch them or not. I have had on more than one occasion, \u201cyou earned 10K while you were away\u201d and as i select the \u201ccollect\u201d button, not the \u201cwatch an ad to get 2x\u201d, not only does an ad play anyway, but then i don't get the 10k. And on top of ALL the annoyances, this game needs major optimizations in performance. It'll run your battery dry in 30 minutes. Just another game in a long list of cash grabs with no substance.</p>|What a disappointing game. The concept is cool, but there is no challenge to it whatsoever. There\u2019s literally no way to lose, and with the small bombs coming in on their own, you can just turn the game on, set your phone down, and rack up money to upgrade. Once to get to a high enough level you unlock all the free bombs and then that\u2019s it. You\u2019ve done absolutely nothing, you\u2019ve gained nothing, and you try not to let your wife know that you\u2019ve waisted your time on a game that is so astoundingly unrewarding that you have to try and convince yourself that you somewhat enjoyed it, but you didn\u2019t. You would have had more fun playing with the plastic ring stacking toy for babies and crying about how your mom made you a PB&amp;J, and you wanted the J to be on the top slice but she handed it to you with the PB on the top and now your whole day is ruined, because it\u2019s more challenging to flip a sandwich over than play this game.

What to know how. I got nightmares from it. First time playing it the night I got it I got nightmares. Here are some suggestions. First, add multiplayer. Come on it\u2019s the best. One multiplayer is online were you need WiFi and local were people near you can play with you. Add mode were you can play as granny. As granny you need to kill all players in your house. To see them you either have to here a sound they made or you see them. When you here a sound or see them there will be a sprint button that come up to run faster. It is the same objective but more people. Two more things, add an insane mode of more pro people. The second thing in the options before entering the game, add an option to two have more granny\u2019s to make it harder. OMG I forgot one more thing add another mode called outside. In this mode your objective is when you escaped the house you need to find your way back to civilization. But before the game there are five boxes. One is for the difficulty, the next one if you want multiple granny\u2019s like I mentioned before, the next is if you want slenderina in it, the other is if you want slenderina\u2019s mother to be in it, and the last one is to have all of them besides difficulty. You can only choose   one of them the difficulty and one of the last four. That is it. That is what I want new in this game. I know it sounds a lot but it  sounds fun doesn\u2019t it.</p>|I think the backyard should be bigger. Make more rooms. This one idea I though would be cool. Have a another room with some type of bird. Every time you go in the room the bird would make noice and granny would come in, but there should be a mask you can put on then the bird can squeak. Make different kills other than the swing of her bat.  There should be a baseball you can throw at her then it can say \u201cGranny is happy with you for 30 secs.\u201d That could be another way to have some free time. Another thing when you get killed under the bed she should drag you out then proceed killing you. The closest should do that to. Make more secrets you can do slender man somewhere. Do something with grandpa. Have some sort of back story. Make more endings I like the to you have, but there\u2019s time for more. Do one with the crossbow. If you have spawned slederina have her be in it. Add more details to the house. (Back to slender man) when you spawn slenderna she could give you a key to slender man\u2019s grave. Which you could have a shovel to look for. Next and last give credit to the comments on here. Give there name and give thanks. Last thing add more things granny can do. (Add to the menu as well.) *If you are reading this thanks for using time to read this. I appreciate the kindness. I hope theses updates will come out. I\u2019m asking this to make the game better. Thank you again for taking the time to reading my comment! Bye!*</p>|I love this game so much! I do have a few recommendations for nee updates. My best friend and I have both completed all the game modes, but wish we could play together in the same game rather than separate. I think there should be a granny multiplayer option. This way you and your friend can both play against granny at the same time. Also, creating another game mode or two would be nice. We spent weeks trying to complete extreme mode. Maybe there should be a mode a little bit easier, and then a mode a little bit harder after. I feel like hard to extreme is a really big step up. Maybe make a mode before extreme without the little cage in the one secret passageway. Or a few less creaking floors. An option to even be granny against a computer or a friend would also be really cool. To make it fair, granny will have limits. For example, if you\u2019re playing as her, you can only put down 5 bear traps in every 10 or 15 minutes. Also, you should only be able to sprint or move faster for a small amount of time. Maybe only being able to check the cupboards and underneath the bed a few times. Creating multiple maps would be pretty cool too. For example, Granny moves to Idaho! She has a new house there or something similar to that. These are all just ideas to make the game even better than it already is. I\u2019m sure others may agree or think the same thing(s).

It was fun and addictive enough. The coins you got when you won matches could be exchanged for small prizes or a life extension if you got beaten. Now, there are \u201cgems\u201d that are the only currency worth gaining anything on the game that are nearly impossible to amass. The Diamond Membership proving structure must have been thought up by an actually insane person with no concept of money at all. I have a HUGE amount of coins collected from playing the game that are essentially worthless now.If the developers are reading this, allow the collected coins, which you\u2019ve now made completely worthless in your game, even though they\u2019re collected through loyal gameplay (which should be rewarded) to be exchanged for gems so players can upgrade characters and they mean something. Maybe 100 coins = one gem. Or some other reasonable radio. Otherwise, the \u201ccurrency\u201d you\u2019re providing for playing the game is absolutely worthless, you\u2019re bombarding players with CONSTANT ads when the game already has very limited lasting appeal, and people are just gonna delete it from their phones. I know I\u2019m close to it. Your pricing structure is absolutely ridiculous. Get real.</p>|I understand the concept of the game. It is good because it teaches you about angles(sorta). Though, this is a good game, it is one of those games children will hide from their parents. It has a lot of morbid content. I am sure no parent would allow their child to play this game if they knew the object/goal was to kill other players. I know that is why this game is for ages 12 and older, but nobody is going to listen to that policy. I know about this game because my older sister downloaded it. Yes, I am a child. I am 11 years old. According to the policy, I could play the game in a year. Yet again, nobody actually reads the policy or pays any attention to the  \u201c12+\u201d imprinted on the page for the app in the App Store. Back to the point, I would like if the creator or producer of the game would make it less morbid. That is why my sister deleted. Her friends did too. When my parents saw what game she was playing they demanded her to delete it. I don\u2019t think people should encourage children and teens (and possibly young adults) to watch and try to kill an animated character. For, that could encourage bad behaviors. That is all I have to say. Otherwise, the game is okay.</p>|Ok first off let\u2019s begin with this, so there are ads but this game IS awesome. So I have no complaints about anything at all though I just want to make this clear. I honestly don\u2019t care much about the ads. Yes there are ads when you come in the game, after you do a round, and when you open a chest (I don\u2019t know all the parts where there are ads I\u2019m just saying the ones I know) but really they are not to bad. Usually there are ads that have little mini games which I LOVE. They also usually have video ads that are like half a minute and most of the time you can skip it. And the ones that are just pictures that stay for a couple a seconds and then you can skip it. Now I\u2019m not a person who\u2019s like \u201cGET ONTO THE GAME\u201d each time there is an ad. To those who play this game and ARE (well even if you are not) the ads are needed because the game is free plus there is and offer of 3.99 to get rid of ads which is decent.

I was advised by my realtor to avoid using Zillow because of inaccurate information. The Zillow website is very user friendly, but just beware it can be misleading. After I bought my new home I \u201cclaimed it\u201d on the Zillow website. They are showing I purchased the home for much less than I did, but they will not correct this information. I called the tax office just to be sure nothing bogus was going on. It turns out my info and the tax office is the same. So long story short, Zillow is not concerned with showing us inaccurate information.Update: After several email exchanges, scanning and submitting documents proving I was providing factual information, Zillow corrected the information I was disputing. The person who helped me seemed polite and helpful. So I changed my review from a 1 star to 3 stars. The reason for 3 stars is I still have several problems with what happened. First off, I still do not know why false information was provided. Second, I do not know why it was so hard to have the information corrected. Third, and this is my biggest problem...I have asked Zillow repeatedly where did they get their incorrect information, and Zillow has never responded to my question.</p>|The aerial view feature of the map function was one if the most important sources of information to me in selecting potential homes to see. It has now been replaced by street view, which in my opinion is NOT needed, since EVERY listing with photographs will have a picture of the house from the street. Plus the street view does not always even capture the house, as there are sometimes terrain, vegetation, or lot issues that tender the street view less than helpful. The now lost AERIAL view not only allowed me to turn the view to see house and nearby properties from four angles, it also allowed me to see details of the terrain (hillside lot, going up or down, how flat a flat lot, sometimes could tell if room between house and lot line for car to access back yard, etc.) NOW WITH THIS FEATURE MISSING, it will be a lot harder for me to determine which homes will qualify for my interest (I am an out of town buyer). Hopefully there is SOME OTHER APP that I can use instead of the updated (I won't say upgraded) Zillow. I have been pleased with many of the features of Zillow, and would have given them a four or five rating. THIS ONE FEATURE IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME AND MY DECISION INFORMATION, I am going to have to lower my rating to 3.</p>|I previously liked this app but when I can no longer use the area view from above to see all sides of the house and the back yard, you made my job harder to find properties in another state. The street view is horrible, slow, and if the house property has an alley, you might see a little of the back, and sometimes you can't. What once took 20 secs now takes minutes to slowly navigate and many times I can't even see the side and back of a house. Please bring back the mapping view where I can use my iPhone to drill in, out and flip to the side views and back yard. This is how I narrowed down options plus it helped to zoom out to evaluate the neighborhood. The upgrade also lost some property lines on that view (iOS 10.3.3). This is also important to me. I want a list of 5 homes to look when I go to my hometown and you made that impossible. I will need to drive to them. People are losing opportunities and your value decrease A GREAT DEAL because of these changes. Please bring the satellite area view back rather than the clunky slow street one.

The experience and functionality are very similar between platforms which make it easy for me to switch between them and still be productive.My biggest problem with the Outlook on iOS though is that it\u2019s completely isolated from the rest of iOS. I understand there are some limitations with this, and maybe some more so on the SDK side of things rather than Microsoft\u2019s, but it\u2019s a bit frustrating that when I try to make a call directly from Phone, I don\u2019t have the option to search through my outlook contacts. Or that when I see an email address on a website that I\u2019m not presented with an option to write that email within the Outlook App. I\u2019m able to share the \u2018mailto:...\u2019 link to a blank email in outlook, but cannot compose an email to that email address.The same extends for calendar. I would love to be able to see my calendar events from outlook in the calendar app, just as a kind of unifying calendar app. I know that I can setup my Office 365 account within the accounts pane in settings, but then I\u2019m defeating the purpose of using outlook.</p>|I can\u2019t believe i\u2019m writing this about a Microsoft app, for the iPhone no less, but this is the best iOS email client i\u2019ve ever used. I\u2019ve used almost all of them, including Gmail extensively. The BEST thing about this app? Focused Inbox. Outlook quickly learns who is important and who isn\u2019t, and delivers notifications only for the \u201cfocused inbox\u201d (unless you have it configured otherwise). Gmail has a version of this but its not as simple and clear-cut as Focused Inbox on outlook. I\u2019d never realized how much time I\u2019d spent paying attention to email notifications that didn\u2019t require attention (receipts, work emails from other departments) - and how Outlook has streamlined my focus by reducing the number of notifications I receive. Outlook for iOS is streamlined to handle multiple accounts super well, including custom notifications per account, calendar account integration (for event creation when email content includes a date or time). The notifications themselves are even better than Mail / Gmail on iOS, allowing me to archive, reply or mark as read from the banner pull-down, without ever needing to enter the app. Even the sounds are better. I\u2019m a believer. Gold standard.</p>|Great app for email and calendar.  Solid performance in this area with one major exception:  My email is based on Exchange 2013 - a Microsoft product - and I have lots of folders and rely heavily on the \u201crules\u201d feature that automatically routes incoming emails to specific folders at the server level.  More than half of the emails I receive fall into this category.  Yet the iOS Outlook app deals very poorly with this feature.  I do not receive any notifications of such incoming emails.  In fact, not only do I have to manually scroll through my folders to see if I just happened to receive new email in that folder, I also have to manually \u201cpull down\u201d the list in each folder to ensure what I\u2019m being shown is the latest status.  Most times it is not.  This is a critical problem with this app that Microsoft has known about for years (just search their own knowledge forums) and has done nothing about.  If they are serious about making an email app for iOS and Exchange users, they would devote the necessary resources to resolve this issue.  I would rate this app 5 stars once this long standing problem has been resolved.</p>", "four_star": "width: 21%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 74%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 1.1M Ratings", "category": "Productivity", "sub_rank": "#7 in Productivity"}, {"size": "99.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/shazam-entertainment-ltd/id284993479?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Shazam is one of the world\u2019s most popular apps, used by more than 100 million people each month to identify music, get song lyrics, and now to discover the music that artists discover themselves.\"Shazam is an app that feels like magic\" --Techradar.comIdentify music instantly and share in the thrill of music discovery with the artists you love.

I\u2019ve been using it since the beginning. For many years it was rumored that Apple would buy Shazam - usually a good thing. Apple tends to make software better after they buyer it (well except for all the professional applications they discontinued after purchasing so they could use pieces of their technology in other, non professional, consumer applications/apps). In this case, Apple made it much harder to link to and buy songs in the iTunes music store. Instead they want to force you to use Apple Music which I have no need for at all with my very large collection of music I already own. Unfortunately, I\u2019m going to switch to another competitor app, which I hate to do. I\u2019m a huge Apple fan, but this app doesn\u2019t work for me any longer. Fortunately, there\u2019s not many songs I like that I don\u2019t already own, so it won\u2019t be that big an inconvenience in my case. These company\u2019s just don\u2019t want you to own anything anymore, they want that consistent monthly income from you renting everything. I hate revolving dept.</p>|There have been songs that truly have  been ingrained in my life since 91' where I never knew who the hell was the artist or song.  On a tv show, a random commercial,  etc. that have slipped through my fingers and traveled onward into the dark distance.   I never caught the artist or the song.   And I would sing these songs carving down the mountain or riding a wave internally for all this time.. When Shazam came out it literally changed my life on this earth.   I finally have found what I have been searching for.  You Shazam have found what I have been searching for.  Now I use it anytime I feel moved in hearing a song at a store, a party, a commercial, a Movie.    It has made me a better person.  We are finally entering an age where the shadow of the sun is no longer.   I beckon the suns musicals waves with the power of Shazam!   Thank you my friend!   You are a beautiful creation.</p>|Okay, so I may not be musically talented, but I\u2019m definitely a huge music fan. I\u2019m always down to listen to new music. No matter where I am, when I hear a good song over the radio or in a store, I Shazam it and it helps me identify it. It\u2019s so much easier than using Siri or Googling lyrics. And every now and then, I\u2019ll use the app to try and understand a song\u2019s lyrics. However, my only issue with the app is the format. I don\u2019t know what it is about it, but it\u2019s slightly confusing and obnoxious. I never use the discover page in the app for this reason. Although, I\u2019m not sure I would use it even if the layout was better. And for those of you who are complaining about the app not recognizing songs, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because the app doesn\u2019t know it. I just think you are simply doing it wrong. I had that issue at first. The app best identifies songs when you open it and wait a few seconds before \u201cShazaming\u201d a song.</p>", "four_star": "width: 6%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 92%;", "one_star": "width: 0%;", "star": "4.9, 3M Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#7 in Music"}, {"size": "141.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/neutron-holdings-inc/id1199780188?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Unlock your ride and your city with Lime, the #1 electric scooter and bike sharing app. Our micro-mobility solutions including dock free rental bikes, e-assist bikes, and electric scooters are available anytime to get you across town or across campus.

Juicers, for those of you who just ride these scooters around, are the contracted employees who pick up the scooters at night and charge them. The app never works properly. I\u2019ve had scorers disappear off of my list of ones I\u2019m charging. Meaning that I go through the work of picking them up and charge them and before I can serve them (so that I get paid) they disappear. Other times I have served limes that after I unloaded and scanned them, they did not serve, and the app wouldn\u2019t let me re-serve them at the same location, meaning I had to load them back up into my truck (sometimes as many as 12 of them) and drive to another location. One night I had to serve 12 limes at 12 different lime hubs. What should have taken 15 minuets ended up taking almost 2 hours. And their \u2018juicer support\u2019 is a joke. They take days if not weeks to get back to you. And when they do respond, if it\u2019s by email they close your ticket before you can respond. If it\u2019s by phone, you can usually hear someone yelling or a baby crying in the background. I also sent over 15 requests to speak to a manager, and have yet to speak with one. Hopefully this company will be bought out by a decent company who cares about the people who work for them. Also hopefully when that new company takes over they will find the person who wrote this app and lock them in a hyperbaric chamber with several rabid cats.</p>|I wish I could rate this 0 stars. What a let down after my initial joy riding LimeScooter for the first time in Austin this past week. I picked up my scooter in front of the JW Marriott and rode it half a mile to Moonshine Grill. There was a problem with the gas lever: I had to turn it like a dial instead of pressing down the lever for speed so that made for a tricky and somewhat dangerous ride. I only discovered this after I started my ride, but I got the hang of the broken lever. My real disappointment happened when I found another scooter (this scooter had a working gas lever) and returned to my hotel. When I initially tried to park and lock the scooter, I received a notification that I was in an illegal parking spot and I could receive a fine, so I moved to an area with other Lime scooters. I tried to park and lock again and got no notification when I proceeded to end the ride so I snapped my picture to complete the process. As soon as I completed the process, I was notified that I was charged a $25 fine! I have tried to reach Lime via the app support process, via their internet page, their phone number and text, but they have yet to respond. If I don\u2019t get my $25 refund from Lime, I\u2019ll consider it the cost for a lesson learned. I should have stayed with Bird Scooters. Their scooters were more likely to be in service than the Lime scooters... and NO BOGUS FINE!</p>|This is an untested, unthought through app. There is no way for one user to activate another\u2019s scooter. What if I kids or I want to pay for someone else\u2019s ride? This problem is identified on the FAQ but WHY WASNT THIS THOUGHT THROUGH INITIALLY????? When the product was RELEASE?! The scooters have been here for months. why hasn\u2019t it been solved? what happens when someone\u2019s phone dies? why would you keep charging someone or worse,  risk a scooter being stolen by another person because YOU DIDNT THINK THROUGH THAT SCENARIO. Also, why weren\u2019t city and local governments included in your decision to litter our city with scooters?! Very unfortunate and frustrating experience. Also, my scooter clocked 20 mph. Not the 15 that was promisedr. I really hope there is more thought put into something that effects so many people. It\u2019s frustrating that factors like other pedestrians, motorists, stoplights, the inability to monitor and regulate drivers as they barrel down sidewalks and risk the lives of others, drunk or incompetent drivers, etc, are not consider. This puts people at risk and you\u2019re really just asking for a law suit. All things that weren\u2019t thought through and  if they were, weren't given the proper attention they deserve.

This is the first review I\u2019ve ever written, and it\u2019s for a reason. This is a good game. Fun to play and a good time passer. The one problem I have with it is the ludicrous amount of ads. I don\u2019t mind an ad every once in a while, or an ad offer for a reward or to continue after you fail, but this game is over the top. I\u2019ve had it for a little while now, and I\u2019m fed up with the ads. I just opened the app, and without me even touching anything, it went straight into an ad. The home screen of the app had barely loaded and it instantly started playing the ad. I am so tired of this kind of thing. I am very disappointed with the developers and hope they make an effort to rectify this. Also, I would like to point out that customers who have not subscribed to get the premium service and leave bad reviews get copy and paste responses from the developers nearly a year or more after the review (this was the case in dozens of reviews), while paying customers who are subscribed to the premium service and leave poor reviews receive personal messages the same day. Very poor customer service and clearly shows that the developers don\u2019t care about non-paying customers in the slightest.</p>|Hi, I love this game. It seriously helps me relax to go to bed. BUT, the ads are SO LOUD. I can\u2019t put my phone on silent because I have to have alarms for the morning and my infant sleeps in our room. I find myself having to play a game and the quickly turn my phone on silent for the ad and then turn it back to normal after the ad. I have the sounds turned off on the game itself but it doesn\u2019t mute the ads. Doesn\u2019t really help with the whole \u201crelaxation\u201d part. So I\u2019m nervous that I will fall asleep during a game and then my alarms won\u2019t go off. I totally understand it\u2019s a free app driven by ads, but players should have the option to have the ads muted. They can still get their point across without being so loud. Yea there is an option to silence the ad but it\u2019s not fast enough, you get screamed at before you can hit the button. So I find myself not playing this so much and choosing candy crush. Having to buy everything in that app is annoying but you can still play without buying and you can disable the sound and that\u2019s it.

This means the last thing you have to do is wait in line because if you order off the app you walk in grab and go. You can also order for children or grandchildren at college or just away from home when they don\u2019t have the time or money to get a coffee or snack from starbucks you can order it and they can grab and go as easy as that.This app works quick and easy. What I mean by this is when you go to the app it is easy to find whatever you want. The layout is easy to understand and the payment method is even easier. After you order it gives you an average time that your order will be done. I am not the waiting type of person so I will go in a few minutes early and see that my drink will be just finishing or already finished because starbucks is on time and tries to stay ahead of the game. There are rewards that you can receive just by using the app. Bonus stars get you up to something they call \u201cGold Level\u201d. After an initial 300 stars every 125 stars after is a free food or drink item of your choice. This gold membership also allows you to have brewed coffee or tea refills and a treat on your birthday.All together this app is great for anyone who is truly a coffee lover and is an on the go type of person. And is a great way to get your children or grandchildren a snack or coffee to get them through the day.</p>|I've used the app for about 3 years and seen it get better and better. Just about everything I've left as feedback for the app has been added to or fixed in the app after the last major refresh. Not that they were listening to me in particular, but it shows that they are trying to make this app a truly useful piece of software. TouchID makes account refills a 15 second affair, favorites make re-ordering sooo much faster, and finally all notifications and promos are in the app, so you don't have to check the website also. The store location maps are now much more accurate. The only disappointment for me is the apps inability to accurately register the quantity of items you've purchased for StarDash promos. Unless you complete a SEPARATE transaction for every item individually in your order, it will not correctly track the number of purchases. 8 of 10 StarDash promos I complete require a phone call to Starbucks customer service to ensure I get all the stars I'm due. They are always cordial, and always fix the issue, but 8 out of 10 times? Really? I won't deduct stars because to be honest, the same thing happens whether you use the app or pay cash at the register. I hear they've fixed this problem with an update, so I will test this update to see if it really and if it works consistently, I'll edit this review.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 85%;", "one_star": "width: 0%;", "star": "4.8, 2.7M Ratings", "category": "Food & Drink", "sub_rank": "#6 in Food & Drink"}, {"size": "141.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/miniclip-com/id337457683?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "\u2022The World's #1 Pool game - now on iOS!\u2022Play with friends!

It\u2019s nothing but a way to earn money without charging to get the app. Example, when I first got on here, winning was easy. My shots lined up and I had no problem beating people as long as I took my time and lined the angles properly. Now that I got a taste of victory and 4 rings all the sudden the same angles don\u2019t work. I scratch more times here than at real pool and my opponent is hard shooting, breaking a cluster and his ball is finding a pocket without a scratch, not the case for me at all, maybe in the beginning. Now down to no coins and having to wait to play the 50 coin table I am tempted to by special offers etc. I will not!! This is a really sad way to make money when they have a ton of advertising going on. Really sad that you get handicapped to lure you to spend for a stupid free game!!! I\u2019m done with it!!Update!!! Played the worst hit the balls as hard as he could on every turn and never scratched, and was able to pocket a rack. I play with precision and take my time, hit very lightly most of the time and I scratched 4 times not counting the break so 5. Piece of crap game that only makes me mad that I get beat by an idiot because this game is a fraud.

Me and some colleagues of mine were arguing about where love balls, the game about pro-pulsing two balls towards one another that have some kind of sexual tension, takes place. Now I, Dr. Ruiz, of the prestigious Xaverian high school, class of \u201821, believe that love balls is occurring during present time in the atmosphere of earth. This is due to the constant force of the balls that also have a gravitational pull, obviously. Now, my colleague, Dr. Neuhaus, has two theories contradictory to my own. He states that according to the Laws of Physics in our universe at this point in the space time continuum, Love Balls is physically inadequate. The Love Balls are obviously under the influence of gravity, because they are pulled downward. However, when they roll they remain at a constant velocity, as if there was no friction at all, contradictory to the Laws of Physics. The only way for Love Balls to be possible in this universe is through the use of magnets, thereby allowing the balls to hover and giving them no friction whatsoever. Love Balls could also be present in a parallel universe or dimension, where the laws of physics were different than our own. We dictated to you this review because we have a strong desire to comprehend the science behind Love Balls. From,Dr. Ruiz and Dr. Neuhaus</p>|This is a cute game, fun to pass time while waiting for an appointment, but the number of ads are crazy RIDICULOUS! It\u2019s not even worth keeping on my phone or iPad b/c it will only irritate me to know there is a possible cute and fun game only to try to play and have 25% game and 75% ads. I don\u2019t mind paying to remove ads, but the ads are so cumbersome that I can\u2019t play the game long enough without the irritation of ad interruptions  to decide if I like it enough to pay for the ad removal option. And it\u2019s the same 4 or 5 ads over and over.... a bit redundant Mr Game Creator. That\u2019s not saying keep the ads and have a wider variety of them, it\u2019s merely stating get rid of 90% of the ads.... PLEASE! Until that happens I strongly recommend to ppl - don\u2019t bother downloading this app it\u2019s a total waste of your time. I know the amount of ads clicked is how the creator makes money, but wouldn\u2019t you rather charge $1.99 for the game and reduce the ads to 1 every 15 or so games? It only makes sense...  profitability would be significantly higher! At the rate of ppl deleting the game such as myself or them not playing it at all, the creator is losing out on much money to be made. I truly hope the creator re-evaluates this and understands ads are not the answer, especially the same few over and over again.

MAKE A VOODOO ACCOUNT CREATOR SO GAME PROGRESS SAVES THROUGH NEW DEVICES AND IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO A DEVICE!!!I absolutely love this game. It\u2019s so addicting and I play it non-stop. I think they should add more skins and maps and more power ups. The extra canon should be the same canon as the one you have and be limited time rather than some small weak one that lacks speed and gets destroyed rather easier. I love ghost mode however that one should stay. Same with freeze mode that one is spot on. One of the challenges for a map is insanely hard to get as you need to destroy 100,000 balls and I\u2019ve had it for a month and only have 90,000 still. As well as the extra canon, the split shot boost isn\u2019t that good and needs improvement if not removal. The coin upgrade is good however and is very beneficial. One last thing is that the farther you get the harder and longer the levels get which can take a longer to time to progress through the game as the cost for upgrades is so much, there should be more value in coins or an upgrade option of the value of the coins so that you are able to upgrade more efficiently and progress farther into the game.</p>|I have played so many games that are in this genre of gaming, the quick, one point of play, time killer games. Some have been alright, but I\u2019ve never enjoyed a game like this as much as I\u2019ve enjoyed this one. This one is so addicting once you get the hang of it! I\u2019m playing it whenever I get a free moment. I even paid to get rid of the ads, and I NEVER do that! It would be five stars, but I do have one issue, and if the developer can help me fix it somehow then I\u2019ll change to a full five. Whenever I return to the game and the \u201cinactive collected coins\u201d box pops up, whenever I try to double the rewards by watching an ad it refuses to work. I press the double rewards button and it just starts up the game like it normally would. I don\u2019t have this issue in between consistent games, if I die I can watch that add to double, and then play again. It\u2019s only when I open the app to start the game that the double rewards button doesn\u2019t work. Please help me, I need those coins to get further!</p>|The number in each thing (sorry for lack of terminology) changes based on your upgrades. My sister didn\u2019t know you could switch the tabs on the upgrades so she only upgrades fire speed. I was wondering how she was on the same level as me, and noticed even though we were on the same level, her top number was about 200 where as mine was 2000! The number in each of the \u201cthings\u201d changes based on how much you upgraded and not solely on the level. To make the game a more fair playing field, it would only make sense to make them all even. Not upgrading the canon is the fault of the player; people who don\u2019t upgrade their canon should not be given pity points just because they aren\u2019t playing strategically. Again I\u2019m the case of my sister, she got stuck on one level, but once she realized she could upgrade other aspects, she flew ahead 10 levels just because she made a mistake in the first hand. The way this game has been structured makes it so you can get much further ahead by leveling up only fire speed until about level 30, then upgrading other things to jump immediately to level 40.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.5, 150.5K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#15 in Action"}, {"size": "26.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/musi-inc/id591560127?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "\"Best free music player app and I\u2019ve tried all of them\" - FaisalBeanzi\"Best music experience I have used on the App Store to date!\" - Lupini66444Musi lets you stream and organize music directly from YouTube, build playlists, share music with friends, and more.

The developers and creators of this app even make advertisements easy on the listeners, allowing us to hear our music rather than listening to advertisements, along with even going back and looking at reviews, they added an equalizer because people asked for it. That is just awesome. Thank you so much for making this app!Edit: I looked at the critical reviews lol, and I had got to say the criticism is a majority of people who are beyond pessimist and just looking for something negative to complain about, or it would seem as there\u2019s something wrong with their internet and they blame it on the app. I\u2019m defending the developers in this that the excessive amount of advertisements is how they get paid and it can help them to actually make the app even better, adding on newer options and the such. To complain about advertisements that you\u2019re both warned about and not forced to stop your music to listen through, is honestly ridiculous. There is not a single thing I can find that is seriously wrong with this app. Much love to the app itself and the developersEdit: I take that back. One flaw I found; is that the shuffle button sometimes doesn\u2019t work correctly</p>|I\u2019m not usually a review person but this app is so good I\u2019ve personally recommended it to many people I know in real life. Not only is is amazing to have a free app that allows you to play music while not in it with repeat functions and playlist options but the equalizer and ability to search lyrics directly from songs is pretty amazing. Also the small things like having words automatically capitalize the first letter when changing song titles really shows that a lot of work and thought went into this app. And with the crazy low cost to remove ads forever, not even that becomes a nuisance. Now if we could be more specific I would honestly give this app a 4.75 stars now that it\u2019s been updated so that you can no longer listen to music offline after loading it while still on WiFi. However I do realize that having an app where you can always listen to music offline by downloading it would just take up space on my phone that I don\u2019t have so I don\u2019t think that would necessarily make the app better. But overall extremely solid, I recommend to anyone who likes listening to music and respects themselves.</p>|So I got Musi a couple months ago, and it has worked smoothly. I\u2019m glad I got his app. There is, however, one problem that I\u2019m starting to see. Yesterday, I had turned on some music and all of a sudden my Siri was activated. I thought nothing of it and just thought it was my phone acting up. Then it happened again. And again. And again. I didn\u2019t think it had anything to do with the app so I just held down the power button and reset the phone. When it turned back on, I played around on some apps for about 30 minutes and the phone worked fine. Siri wasn\u2019t activated unless I said so. Then I turned on musi again and Siri popped up again without me saying or doing anything. I then went to my settings and turned off Siri. Then when I went back on musi again, it started skipping and pausing songs without me pressing anything. And then instead of activating Siri (because it was turned off) it now activated voice control. I don\u2019t know if this is just happening to me or other people too, but I just wanted to present this to the creators so it can be fixed before it becomes too big of a problem.

This application provides users with tools to translate between languages and they now include an image option; users take a photograph of a sign, piece of paper, or other form of written text and receive a translation in the language of their choice. This augmented reality is ground breaking because this allows online learners to access content in other languages. The application also translates spoken word in real time, which allows all learners to access audio in written form, in their own language, online or in-person. This version of augmented reality that is adapted for education can be utilized in an online learning environment and can be utilized by instructional designers. One of the major challenges with instructional design is selecting the correct tools to build learning experiences. With this application, instructional designers are able to create a course in their own language and can make their lesson accessible to learners by recommending Google Translate for accessibility.  I plan to utilize this in conjunction with my online lessons and videos in order to reach more students with diverse abilities and primary languages.</p>|Many times when I record audio or pictures, the translation doesn\u2019t even come up. The audio is worse since no matter what I do, speaking into the microphone is just a bust. I\u2019ll say something into the microphone, and it won\u2019t do anything. It doesn\u2019t even load, it just indefinitely waits for me to say more. No matter how much I say, real words or not, it doesn\u2019t ever even acknowledge that I\u2019m done talking and if I hit any buttons, the X to close it or microphone button that you\u2019d think would tell what it said, just cancel out of it.Not to mention, taking pics is a nightmare. You have to highlight with your finger the phrases you want translated, but you can\u2019t move the picture around easily. So if you zoom into a certain part, it\u2019s hard to zoom back out, and you can\u2019t move the picture at all without zooming in or out. So if you zoom out in a way that makes the pic go off to the side, well, too bad. Why can\u2019t it just detect the words itself? Or at the very least, why can\u2019t I translate more then one thing in a picture, and do I have to take the same picture again and again just to see everything it says?</p>|I use many different languages throughout each day, usually just little phrases here and there in my writing. This app is indispensable to me as I work, and the translations seem to just get better and better with each update. I\u2019ve read a few of the negative reviews, and while I\u2019m sure the inconveniences described by these folks are real, it also seems they me be expecting a bit too much. The app is very straightforward in its basic function of translating text that is input by the user. The app is also by Google, and thus it is highly aspirational in its features, and each update seems to bring further enhancements that may or may not be truly useful. I understand how this might get frustrating, but that\u2019s just Google\u2019s style. Eventually the kinks get worked out based on user feedback, which is how I think it should be. As far as a basic free translation app, this one is far and away the best.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.5, 32.2K Ratings", "category": "Reference", "sub_rank": "#2 in Reference"}, {"size": "81.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/discord-inc/id658886503?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Discord is the only cross-platform voice and text chat app designed specifically for gamers.

Although, lately I spotted some issued bugs on discord. Lately, it has keep crashing for me, and won\u2019t let me back on. Sometimes when I go fast in roles or chats or something. It crashes like nothing, and then I\u2019m stuck outside of the app and no available to join back in, regarding this issue it made me mad. But this app does have it\u2019s benefits. Such as great communication, and things as I said before. Therefore, the reason why I have a 3 Star. Mainly because the bugs are highly repetitive and annoying. I generally find discord great, but the app tends to crash too often and not load on back often. Which also makes me unable to communicate with other friends or people. It\u2019s bad for IOS for some reason. That ticks me off when I see the same things not be fixed or repeating keep coming back and start to annoy me. As I write this, I even TRY to get back on, but it won\u2019t let me and I crash, every time I get a update from discord, I get more crashes/bugs for some apparent reason in the IOS version of discord. Regarding the fact atm, I can\u2019t even go back on discord. Discord does tick me off in many ways. Such as, the crashing, the multiple bugs, and the community itself sometimes. I would like to get noticed about this issue and others that people are currently experiencing in the IOS version of discord. - Some random guy on the internet.</p>|Discord is a great tool for gaming, streaming, and almost anything you need out of a communication service/application. Yet it is lacking sometimes there is server lag or buggy happening on pc and the phone version usually just the phone version but its come along way and most of the bad issues are completely fixed. I just wish it was more compatible with certain devices, for example i don't have a great pc but it is good enough to play arma 2 - 3 with 60 frames yet discord likes to kill my cpu time usually freezes and such as well, despite playing with the prioity setting it higher or lower doesn't fix the problem. Ios version seems fine most of the time but sometimes has server lag or disconnects. But all in all its one of the best alternatives to paid communication services for gaming and streaming, and i am if it wasn't free it would be the best of paid applications, its simple you can create free servers and manage those servers with ease. btw in your update log you wrote \"with relative easy\" instead of relative ease. The best part i would say is how easy and how quickly you can create and connect with people so you can just get into your game and start playing. Thank you discord! i hope you continue to improve and fix this application, its been a few years since i have even looked at teamspeak and its all thanks to you guys|~&lt;3</p>|I like Discord for what it offers, but the iOS app crashes randomly whenever I try to load a picture, gif, song, or other upload someone else posted, and crashes when I try to post pictures quite frequently. I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. Another issue is that the app has decided to randomly mark all messages in random chat channels as read when I open them, even though I\u2019ve still got dozens to read before I reach the end of the string. Or I\u2019ll be reading the messages, and suddenly it marked all messages as read, to include ones that happen while I\u2019m reading, and not even remotely caught up. It happens randomly, so I don\u2019t even know what might be the issue. It might happen to a chat every time I open it, or just once in a while but it\u2019s a bug I want to see gone. Being tagged in a message, and then having that indicator removed randomly is an issue. I don\u2019t always have time to read everything in one sitting, so I want to be assured that I can read it later. It is a major issue when it starts you over at the end of the conversation, and doesn\u2019t save from where you had to leave off. (This is mostly for my admin duties on servers.)I like that I have the ability to take Discord with me, but if I can\u2019t use it half the time, then it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even have it at all.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 86%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 465.5K Ratings", "category": "Social Networking", "sub_rank": "#7 in Social Networking"}, {"size": "194.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/cheetah-technology-corporation-limited/id949821679?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Stunn scenes with amazing 3D effects; one-touch operation, easy to use!Swipe left and right to control the ball.

The different aspects make this game possibly one of the most fun out of all the games I have downloaded on the App Store. However, there are some problems that need serious solving.The game overall is very fun to play. I enjoy racing through different obstacles and the colorful, creative themes of each level are quite interesting and amazing. I especially enjoy that you move your \u201cball\u201d completely manually, making it through each level. However, the cost of having unlimited balls is outrageously pricey. I understand that $2.99 really isn\u2019t that expensive, but why do you have to pay? I also am completely aware of the fact that most free apps include in-app purchases, but couldn\u2019t there be a more efficient system for the developers to make a profit? You could have \u201cperks\u201d like changing the color of your ball, or having lives or other aspects that make the game more fun for younger players. Also, the addition of new levels is nice, but alas, there is a price to pay just to play that level. Why should anyone be limited to about 12 levels (if I\u2019m correct) when there are so many more to play? I personally think it\u2019s ridiculous to have to pay many expenses just to have the full experience of the game.Overall, Rolling Sky is a very successful, exciting game, but too many money-related issues may just be the downfall of this game.</p>|When I downloaded this game, I can't remember seeing any ads whatsoever. I forgot about this game, but I recently started again and realized how enjoyable it is. But lately, I have noticed an increase in ads that seems to be a little desperate. I realize that the company puts ads in the game for a reason, but it's reaching a point that makes it seem like you can't play the game at all. Every time I click a button, an ad pops up. It wouldn't be that bad if they were just five to ten second ads, but these are thirty seconds long, and you can not skip them. They simply just get in the way and make it inconvenient for the player. Something else I've been noticing lately is whenever I try to start again if I crash or don't complete level is it has a Google pop-up and I can't click off of it. And, every time I try to click away, it takes me to that page and I have to load the game back up. Also, whenever I try to watch an ad to get 10 more balls or start at a checkpoint, I'll click it and then in the end it won't give me what I asked for. It seems like the game is a inconvenience with the excessive amount of ads. Overall, I love the game and it's quality and hope that it can be improved so I can throughly enjoy it once more.</p>|I\u2019ve been playing this game for over three years and might I say Rolling Sky is so addictive and it gives me a challenge. I like how you make a harder and easier version of the levels. (Exp. :Reggae-harder, Mental Rave- easier... Neon-harder, Dazzle-easier) The overall aspect of the game is just so fun! The levels are very colorful and detailed, the music is catchy(love the music... a lot!) and different ball skins are cool, too especially if you get bored with the regular one. The Alan Walker theme is AWESOME (probably because I like Alan walker) and like I said a pretty great game, one of the best.A few minor things: I get lots of ads\ud83d\udc4e and having to watch all those videos for little stuff like gaining only three hearts is a little excessive. There should also be a tutorial button in the settings or something so people know how to play. I had to learn on my own how to play and it took me like a month just to finish Massive and that was the easiest level(at the time when you didn\u2019t have Cloud) but since this game so fun, I\u2019m giving it five stars\ud83d\ude09. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who likes a challenge!</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 71%;", "one_star": "width: 8%;", "star": "4.3, 30K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#6 in Board"}, {"size": "203.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/grubhub-com/id302920556?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "With the largest selection of restaurants, Grubhub delivers your favorite foods to your door.Order with a few simple taps in the iOS Grubhub app and get the restaurants you love, delivered.

The first time was a few months ago from a steves crazy subs and everything was great! My order was completely right even with it being complicated and the driver seemed nice. This time we ordered from subway and I honestly wanted to leave the review on the subway shop in the app, but it said the review was \u201cskipped\u201d which I never skipped it... well we got our food pretty quick so the service was good, but I found a hair inside my sandwich \ud83e\udd22 which has never happened before to me at any subway! The wrappers on the sandwiches and the napkins in the bag were all damp and I thought it could have been from grease but my sandwich wasn\u2019t greasy enough for it to get all over both sandwiches and the napkins. I think it was water or something because I don\u2019t think it was grease. I also asked for lots of olives on my sandwich because it\u2019s the only thing I get besides the meat and I got hardly any olives on the sandwich. We also asked that the driver call us when they arrive because we have dogs that bark at everything and will try to get outside if somebody\u2019s here and they knocked; which isn\u2019t that big of a deal but it showed that they didn\u2019t read ANY of my notes that I added. I guess so far Grubhub is hit or miss depending on where you\u2019re getting food from. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ordering from that subway again and I wish I could have left them a review in the app.</p>|This was a great way on my lazy days to get food when I didn\u2019t feel like driving. Then yesterday the Chinese restaurant I usually ordered from handed over my food to one of the drivers and I waited this was about a 40-50 minute waiting time which is normal on Thursdays and towards the weekend. The thing is my food said delivered but it never came. I automatically contacted Grubhub and after speaking to one of the reps she said that the driver wasn\u2019t answering the phone and basically had the food but just didn\u2019t deliver it. I was really heated about the situation because of the wait and it was going on a hour and 29 minutes and I paid 18 dollars that I was out of currently. The rep offered a full refund which is fine but I thought more would be given after experience with places like Uber and Postmates who gave me my refund plus more which was fair because of the wait and money being out my account which is a process for the refund to even get back in my account. After reflecting on this I\u2019m not trying be Greedy and I know it\u2019s not grubhub fault but it is one of their drivers and it\u2019s a big inconvenience for me. Only think I got from the rep after expressing my anger was \u201cI\u2019m  sorry and was that all\u201d. I think I am officially done with grubhub plus with places like Postmates offer way more places to eat and even shop from their app. I still gave them 3 stars off of past experiences.</p>|It\u2019s just sad because the service is an amazing idea, allowing any restaurant to deliver for a small extra fee, it\u2019s something I was so excited to try it out when it was available in my city and I could not wait to try it out. I had picked a delicious burger place near my house and I chose a burger with fries, an appetizer and a dessert. The app is so easy to use and it was so easy to put my payment info and order the food and went very smoothly. 30 minutes went by and I was wondering where the food was, it was a Tuesday so they could not possibly be that busy! I called the restaurant at 35 minutes in and they said the food had been picked up 15 minutes ago... so 15 more minutes go by and I get a phone call from the automated grub hub number and it connected me to the driver, which I think is a great idea to make things easier. I step outside to get my food which took over an hour and I get the boxes of food from him, creepy driver, not Grubhub\u2019s fault just an odd guy. I go inside open the box for the burger and it is very cold and it was so obvious that the fries had been picked at. The dessert was missing and the appetizer also looked like it had been picked at as well. I think this service would excel if they were more careful with the drivers they chose and have more time penalties for those drivers. Overall a great service if you get the right driver.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 84%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 1M Ratings", "category": "Food & Drink", "sub_rank": "#3 in Food & Drink"}]
