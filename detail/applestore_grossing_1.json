It just started when you guys updated it. Sometimes when I just land on a building or even before that. The second to last  thing is that the shooting button is on top of the joy stick. And I notice that you tried to make it easier by having it be able to tap on the screen to shoot but for me it barely works. I could be tapping on my screen trying to snipe or shoot another person. So please put the shooting button to the right or in the settings put controls and have people be able to drag things where they want and have a test run with an AI. The last thing ties in with the thing I said earlier but when reloading a gun with that small little circle it could make you shoot and give away your cover and when opening a chest. I would like a button that opens the chest. For example I try to open a chest and I try again and again then I destroy the chest. One more thing is the 50v50. It was the most fun I ever had on fortnite and yes I play on Xbox one. As I was saying it was fun. The whole team got together and built a huge for and one guy from the opposite team the whole team would rain fire on him. I would really want it back for good and not limited time only. Again I wouldn\u2019t want it to crash that much.</p>|I\u2019m tired of other reviews saying it lags so much on cellular data. The game is trying to connect to 100+ people at the same time trying to get a stable connection where it runs decently. If you could somehow add a configuration for a controller that would be cool unless I didn\u2019t notice that it is already a thing. The graphics are so far good for mobile game. The reason I got the game is to go on playground or something with my friends. It also be cool if you added some sort of launcher that locks on to vehicles like the planes for example. The person flying the plane would have to spin and get lucky if it misses. The rocket would only have so much fuel though. Sort of like the old launcher but you can\u2019t fully control it. You\u2019ll have to lock on until the crosshair turns to a different color.It would be cool if you had a mode where people in planes attack the other team which are in a base with the anti aircraft and some other guns but you can\u2019t hijack a plane. The other team could have people drop in with some gun from the planes. The base would have traps all around it and they would be breakable. The planes wouldn\u2019t be able to ram into the base but they can shoot the outer walls and shoot inside. If the pilot dies then the plane would blow up. The pilots wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the plane. It could be a 50 v 50 like thing but the base is huge. Just an idea for future modes.</p>|I love this mobile game you can move around controls and is easy to play, it\u2019s also really fun and not violent at all no blood etc. but it\u2019s not the same and they added CONTROLLER SUPPORT witch is super annoying, and your thinking isn\u2019t that good, well it\u2019s not, it gives other players huge advantages and disadvantages to players without a remote plus once you get good with mobile controls and then people get controllers and you used to be better than them but now that they have a controller your way worse. Onto the actual game, the games great don\u2019t get me wrong but it could be 10x better, they took away stuff that no one and when I say no one I mean no one asked the thing to get taken away for instance double pump was the best thing ever what did they do take it away and make the gun do 7 damage every headshot, also they added way to much stuff: rifts, rift to goes, boom boxes, ports fortress\u2019s when they had port-a-forts, also p90\u2019s are a joke they are the fastest firing gun in the game next to the mini gun and do as much damage as regular AR\u2019s also no need for the heavy AK if you already have AR\u2019s and also scars, no need for infantry rifle, bring back semi auto sniper, get rid of turrets they are the most over powered and stupid item in the game. Also why bring Bach OG skins, because Epic Games is so greedy, they did it for the money no other reason. Make the game Back to how it used to be please and everyone will love it how they used to</p>", "four_star": "width: 6%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 83%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.6, 3.7M Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#1 in Adventure"}, {"size": "287.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/niantic-inc/id1037205060?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "NEW!

It was super popular and the servers couldn\u2019t handle it. Now the developers push a new event almost all the time. Getting mew was fun and challenging(Ditto). Celebi and Spiritomb were arduous to obtain but Meltan has been extremely challenging because I don\u2019t have a Nintendo switch. They have also pulled off some very awesome community days once a month where you get a similar ambiance to when the game first came out. Tons of people playing! They also used one of them to introduce a new mythical Pok\u00e9mon in a very creative way. I have enjoyed the new raid and research updates. We just need more ways to get silver pinaps. Trading has been introduced to the game in a way that doesn\u2019t ruin it and trading rare Pok\u00e9mon with strangers is costly but with people you interact with daily it\u2019s cheap. The game is mostly free to play but I have personally spent some money on it. There was an egg event and I wanted more incubators. Anyways I wasn\u2019t ever forced to buy anything and it isn\u2019t like other apps where they throw sales in your face as pop ups every time you log in. You can earn 50 in game coins per day without paying a dime but that can be drastically easier or harder based on where you live. In the past year this game has drastically changed into something truly addictive and fun to play. I can\u2019t wait to see what they bring to the game next year.</p>|I am loving all of the events and things we have to look forward to. Community days were a great idea. Friends and trading were wonderful updates that added a lot to the game, though I wish that there was an option to toggle off the exact location and map directions in the gift you send people. Even better if you could turn on/off per friend level or even individual friends as well as an all on/off. Also, if you could create a kind of lure for gyms where raids are happening, and nearby players could see that and head over because they know people are there to raid. Lure could last 5-10min so people can wait for it to run out (and if they don\u2019t want to wait, they don\u2019t use the lure). And nearby players can view the raid and leave like a thumbs up or thumbs down so others know someone is on their way. The GO community has really come together and made raid planning possible in a lot of places, but this would be more inclusive to those that haven\u2019t joined their local community or that live rurally and have a hard time getting enough people. These are just suggestions for improvements to an already amazing game that I am pretty happy with, Pok\u00e9mon GO has come a long way since those first several months of release where I always seemed to be annoyed at Niantic. So, well done :)</p>|I love the game and its easy to use interface but I and all of my friends at school agree that your amazing game lacks some necissary content to be a truly great game. I belive you should add trading pokemon above all else and along with that casual battles with near by players. Now for my personal favorite addition is that some people have a daily struggle with living in a small town like mine where there is literaly 1 pokestop in all of town and you never go near it so that results in having a very limited supply of poke balls which is by far the most important item in the game because without them you cant catch anything which results in the lack of xp which means you cant level up. You cant get good cp pokemon (much less pokemon at all) which means no gyms or raids. To combat this major issue I propose you and some sort of daily spin or add more pokestops and gyms.    Now I doubt you (the devs) will see this much less read it all but if you do I greatly appreciate it. Thank you as I hope this may help bring life back into this once amazing and well played game.P.S. ( I am saying this not only to make this game more fun for me but all of the friends I play this game with are compaining about a few of these issues and I would like to continue playing the game with the game with them as this is the only game I play and I fear they may quit playing if you do not add content. )</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 61%;", "one_star": "width: 17%;", "star": "4.0, 148.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "N/A"}, {"size": "81.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 7%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/netflix-inc/id363590054?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Looking for the most talked about TV shows and movies from the around the world?

I also love that I can watch movies everywhere. However there are two \"updates\" that I feel actually set this app back. First I really hate that I can't rate movies and shows I watch by star ratings, unless I log in on an old device that doesn't have updates, or a computer. If I just watched it on my device or smart TV, I want to be able to rate it there. Unfortunately now the rating is only a thumbs up or down. I don't like how limited that is. I might like a movie, but not love it, or not really want to see it again for a while, however with the thumbs up, unless I remember everything about the movie I won't know how much I liked it. So now I feel unless I love a movie I have to give it a thumbs down. So personally I give a huge thumbs down to this new way of rating. I think it is definitely a downgrade. Second I wish on the new updates it would say if a show or movie is being taken off. For example I was watching one of my shows on my old Wii (which hasn't updated the software in a really long time), and on my Wii it told me that my show was only going to be available until October 9th. However when I turned the same show on my smart TV, and IPhone it didn't say anything. It would just be nice to see if the movie or show you're watching is going to be removed within the next month or so.</p>|I love Netflix BUT they stop one of my shows and it was a cliffhanger and it was mad in 2015 you think by now you you would put on the 3 season but no come on I Watch it over and over hoping you would put it on Netflix please Netflix i love the show please bring it back I watch it every day till it stopped I hope this will make you bring the 3 season if you don\u2019t well I probably will not go on Netflix because it is  a wast of my time and what would I do sit on Netflix not satisfied wow Netflix that is low even for you so please please read this if you do thank you so much I will tell you the name of the show do you want to make me happy and i will leave a bad review so please please please I am begging you to it will make me happy I put 5 \u2b50\ufe0f so Netflix please please put the 3 season of some assembly required I love that show I am making this so long for you you please I will write reviews that are really good if you put it on there I am a little girl and I love this show and it makes me laugh it mite not be so popular but please you care don\u2019t you once again it is called \u2b50\ufe0f some assembly required \u2b50\ufe0f please it is hard to explain but I love that show and I was really sad when it stopped if I were you I would make the little girl happy ps me</p>|I\u2019m a huge entertainment buff whether it be games or movies. It\u2019s just how I pass my free time when I\u2019m not working. Netflix provides a endless amount movie I wouldn\u2019t usually find on other other apps but if that was all it would be maybe \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f to me because that\u2019s nothing special. What makes Netflix a \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f you ask? Why is Netflix The Goat? To put it simply they never stop trying to entertain you, raising the bar through originals that other platforms would only wish to be tall enough to reach. Just going to give you one of many creative concepts Netflix has recently added that inspired me to write this. It\u2019s Called \u201cBlack Mirror- Bandersnatch\u201d. A movie based of their \u201coriginal\u201d hit series. This movie is a psychological thriller that on its own would be another hit putting another notch on the already crowded belt of this Powerhouse. This is the kicker though, you interact with this movie. Thats right, combining the movie experience with a video gaming feel! Oh and the movie has a gamer theme to it adding to the anxiety and pressure to make the right choices. I\u2019m not going to ruin this for you but I really hope you experience this where you don\u2019t just press play you\u2019re playing. Netflix, shaking the pillars.

So here it is again! Nothing has changed. Still haven't received a mystery box. Still like the game though. Follow up - 4 months have gone by and I still haven't received the mystery box!  A couple of months ago I purchased the bundle for $6.99. Not only did I not receive a mystery box, which I understand has happened to many who have purchased this bundle, but I received less than the correct number of gold bars. Do you think anyone responded to my issue after contacting the app developer?  Nope!  Don't waste your money on purchasing anything from them.  Their pockets are getting heavier.  If I could rate this game a minus zero, I would - just because of their non response!  Well a month has gone by and I still haven't received my mystery box.  What a shame! 2018 and I still like the game. However, I am still waiting for that mystery box! So, months have continued to pass by. Lol, loving the game. It has become more interesting over the years. PS - still waiting for the mystery box.........a few days have passed by since my last review. I still like the game, but doggone it I wish I would receive that mystery box! Lol. Waiting patiently..............</p>|Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love this game. But it has its flaws. When you fail a level, normally you can see that you only need one simple move to pass it. It gives me the option for 5 more moves, but you have to buy it with \u201cgold bars\u201d. Like, who wants \u201cgold bars\u201d? You spend way too much money to BUY them, so no, I\u2019m not using gold bars. I don\u2019t even know how you earn them! I got 5 for downloading the app, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever received. You would think they would have a solution if you went to the help center, but no. I get that they have to gather money somehow, but they would get far more if they didn\u2019t charge $3 a pop. More people would buy, more money. But it also makes no sense to put in your credit card number and spend all your sweet time to buy a 10 pack of gold bars for $3.00. It will also give you and option to \u201cspin the wheel\u201d. No one EVER gets the jackpot, because it\u2019s rigged. Like, why would you even put the jackpot on there if no one can get it?! Plus it gives you an option to spin and win a \u201cbooster\u201d. Like why would you want a booster if your out of moves and can\u2019t use it to pass your level?! They could at least give you one more move to burst that one jelly cube you have left.

They also rescue the ducks, which is a skinned version of any of the other game\u2019s toys are animals. Please do realize that a lot of people really know this is true. Delete this game, please. All of those 5 star reviews should be fake unless this is the first type of game they have encountered. As so as the money problem in this game. I have seen that people have been spending quite a bit in this game to make it more possible and \u201cfun\u201d for them to get through a level. But, indeed, I played until level 102 or so. This was the check out all the same features it has like any other game like this. To add on, people who think this is not a cliche, I am sure that this game was created after the original ones, which I do not play since it is not my type of game. It\u2019s rather how many ads are on this game and how stupid it is to think that people have played this when there is the original, but still fun, games using this layout as well. If you play this game, I understand that you may like it, but I just want to put a warning for the people who may agree. I give this game a strait on fail in creativity and a half fail on fun. Thanks for reading and I hope it gives you a point.</p>|I\u2019ve played this game not long after it became available. I\u2019m at the top tier plus play through the \u201c champion \u201c levels until another 50 levels are added then play on. I\u2019ve watched every facet: how the block falls sequence, how the buttons for purchase items are placed....on and on. Yes, the game programmed in a way that will exhaust your resources and the mat layout positioned to make you accidentally spend gold.  The common misconception is to expect anything less. The developers and publishers analysis players and construct to maximize profits. It\u2019s no different than slots. The problem is there is no regulatory or oversight commission to protect the player. So other than common sense, we are at the mercy of a new group:Game Publishers. The game developer arena is saturated and highly competitive with the goal to make a product people like...same as always. The publisher takes the product and maximizes the profit potential. This a cold group with the old  \u201crobber baron\u201d intent. Until something intercedes, players are at their mercy and they have none. So, play with caution and common sense. It\u2019s difficult to show restraint when your set up at every turn but that\u2019s life. I\u2019m an old man and like the saying goes, \u201cseen it and been there\u201d....over and over again.</p>|I used to really enjoy this game and played whenever I was bored or had a few minutes to kill. I was all the way to the Championship rounds (once you beat the boards developed, you replay some of the more difficult boards in order to continue helping your team and still play the game) however, the new updates created more glitches in the game and the developers have done nothing to fix them. The one most talked about on my team was the \u201cstar chest\u201d rewards. Once you collect 20 stars, you open a chest and, depending on how many lives you have, you get hearts/lives. Well, I received on 2 separate occasions hearts from my chest that were not added to my lives. I wrote both times to support and was advised that 1.) because of the new update, the hearts go to the stash box (which I knew however they didn\u2019t\u2014hence my concern) and 2.) I was mistaken and it wasn\u2019t hearts I received (which it was but there is a glitch...) so I would not be getting any. I played this game multiple times a day and sometimes paid for extra items and coins but after the second glitch and response from the developer, I decided to keep my money and time and promptly deleted this game and my stats. I will never support this developer and I suggest you all save your money and time as well.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 80%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 1.1M Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#21 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "76.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/hulu-llc/id376510441?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Only Hulu gives you access to the largest streaming library so you can watch thousands of shows and movies, exclusive Originals, past seasons, current episodes, and more on your favorite devices.

People are saying it\u2019s not user friendly but I don\u2019t see that at all. I\u2019ve never had a problem with crashing, the app not opening, or the app not loading properly. Whenever I\u2019m in a location with poor service, the app still loads all the show selections and I can still watch it without constant buffering like the Netflix app. It also looks sleek and not so plain like Netflix. I honestly loved the new overhaul update and when it first came the rwd/ffd would go whenever you touched the screen but now you have to tap the screen to do that function. So, in my mind the problem was fixed. I love the app, people just need to cool it.</p>|Why is it that your app is the ONLY app I have issues with streaming on my iPhone?? I had to delete the app and now that i have re-uploaded the app when I go to login to my profile it states that my internet connection is the problem but I can literally log into Netflix and stream immediately after getting that response from your app!!?? So, if you can manage to take my $7.99 a month without any problems then I should be able to use your service just the same. But that ain\u2019t the case and I would like a resolution immediately or a reimbursement for services not rendered. This problem has been going on for the past few weeks for other customers as well - isn\u2019t there a team of IT staff that should be addressing these issues??!!??</p>|To describe Hulu\u2019s new user interface as torturous barely scratches the surface. Touching the screen to access the player controls causes the entire image to be obscured. The controls remain on the screen for several seconds after playback resumes, leading the user to touch the screen in an attempt to make them go away (so the video can be viewed); this usually results in changing the position of the \u201cplayhead\u201d or \u201ctimeline\u201d control, skipping to some other random part of the program. There is simply no excuse for this poor of a design. But at least Library navigation is utterly bewildering, indicating the developers are fully committed to making the app unusable in any respect. Airplay support has also been removed, which is simply hateful.</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 84%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.7, 910.7K Ratings", "category": "Entertainment", "sub_rank": "#2 in Entertainment"}, {"size": "153.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/roblox-corporation/id431946155?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Roblox is the ultimate virtual universe that lets you play, create, and be anything you can imagine.

How do I begin? ROBLOX is an AMAZING APP! But yet again there are bad things to it! What should I talk abut first? The good thing about it, or the bad thing? I\u2019ll start off with a good thing! ROBLOX is an AMAZING game! Great ways to make friends and RolePlays! To be honest sometimes RolePlays Can be kinda of cringy, but it\u2019s totally fun! I really enjoy these games (Bloxburg, Royal High, Work At A Pizza Place, Robloxian High School, Roblox High School, Roblox High School 2) because they are great games to RolePlay on! Mostly Bloxburg! You can make your own house and design it the way you want to! And it\u2019s so realistic! And you can have a nice RolePlay with your friends! But now I have to talk about the bad things of ROBLOX. ROBLOX can be a fun game and all, but kids are getting cyber bullied from it. It\u2019s either because they don\u2019t have robux. I think that everyone who makes a new account should at least be given 90 robux to start off with. The other problem is that kids are also getting to addicted to the game! Kids might have to do something important like a project or homework and may leave it at for last minute because they were either laying in bed playing ROBLOX! I\u2019m not saying that I don\u2019t get addicted, because I do! I also think that the other problem is the Tags! I once tried to RolePlay but it was so difficult trying to say something when it went tags. Thank you for reading my comment about ROBLOX, and sorry it was long! Bye!</p>|Roblox is a. Great game but people with no robux  get cyber bullied and that\u2019s not good but I\u2019m glad u can report cuz I feel bad and u can role play play with other people and it will not let u say bad words u can make friends follow chat play games like bloxburg royal high and other games that are fun and u can costumize ur character and join all ur friends and cyber bullies mostly always get banned from a game there are many different games to play to have fun when ur bored u can make group chats but u can only have a limit of 200 friends but it\u2019s still very fun and u don\u2019t always have to accept friend request sometimes people might online date but just report them the could get banned for that like me .im friends with friends from school and cousins and my brother and other people who are really nice just don\u2019t get scammed by the people who say they will give free robux if they have builders club that means they don\u2019t need ur password and those aren\u2019t scams but people who need your password they could hack ur acc so plz be careful my cousin got hacked we don\u2019t know who hacked her I thought she was planking me but she texted me saying she couldn\u2019t get in and I sent her a pic that she was in a game and luckily she got in bc she put her email , And don\u2019t cyber bully u could end up being banned it doesent matter if u have robux or not roblox is a game for fun and it is fun have fun role play or do something else fun. When ur bored just play roblox =D.</p>|Ok so, ROBLOX is an amazing game that I\u2019m happy people from over the world can join. But, although it\u2019s a great game, there are bad things in the game that happen.           One bad thing about ROBLOX is that online dating. Young players could be in serious trouble with ODers. Kids don\u2019t know who to trust and who they can\u2019t trust. Like, \u201cI\u2019ll give you free robux if you date me.\u201d Kids could be in danger just because of this problem. So stop ODers.            Another bad thing about ROBLOX is scammers. Players playing a scammers server, for example, putting in your password for \u201cfree robux\u201d but truly never gives you robux, if just gives you your account being hacked. So please ROBLOX, if someone makes a new server called \u201cFree Robux\u201d please delete the content immediately. Who knows how many accounts have been deleted.             AAAH!!! This reason makes me really mad. Reports don\u2019t even work!!! Just like the reasons before, what if someone is ODing?! And you can\u2019t do ANYTHING about it!!! And what if someone is scamming?!? SORRY, CAN\u2019T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE REPORTS DON\u2019T WORK!! Please ROBLOX please, make the report button useful for once!            Overall, ROBLOX is a great game, just please change some things about it! I know you guys have like a list of rules and guidelines, but WAKE UP! Not all players follow the rules! And someone wanted to OD be before, but of course I didn\u2019t do it! So please, make ROBLOX a safe place again. \ud83d\ude09</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.6, 812.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#2 in Adventure"}, {"size": "142.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/supercell/id488106216?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Join millions of players worldwide as you build your village, raise a clan, and compete in epic Clan Wars!Mustachioed Barbarians, fire wielding Wizards, and other unique troops are waiting for you!

If you have 100 Walls to upgrade at 9,000,000 in gold per section, but it takes you 6 months or more to earn 4,000,000 in gold, then it would literally take you over 3 years to get all of your Walls to the same level. Keep in mind, that in order for your gold coffins to hold 9,000,000 in gold, you have to collect enough gold first to upgrade the coffins to a level that allows them to be big enough to hold that amount in gold. And to do that, it would mean you have to spend the gold you're trying to save up to upgrade the walls. So after upgrading all of your gold coffins you have to start all over from scratch and save up 9,000,000 in gold just so that you can upgrade ONE section of your 100-sectioned Walls. I've been playing this game for over 5 years, and i still have purple diamond-like walls, with a combination of some black marbled-stone-like walls. I can't acquire enough gold to get my walls matching, because it takes so long to collect, upgrade and wait for things to finish upgrading, as well as it costs so much to build your defenses up. Just to upgrade a bomb tower to level 2, costs over 2,000,000 in gold. 2million for a level 2? Anything that's level 2 will be destroyed in 2 seconds. Over-priced!!!</p>|It\u2019s so easy to pre train troops and sometimes you keep your training queue full because you raid often. If you want to donate troops to a friend you\u2019d have to delete some troops to train some for them. So! The idea is a new building. The Cantina! It holds up to 20 troops at town hall lvl 8 and +5 for all the levels that you decide to add. With this cantina building an new tab is present on your training/brewing/quick train screen labeled \u2018Cantina\u2019. In this new tab you\u2019re able to train troops that cannot be used in battle, but can only be donated. The building should be the size of a camp but that\u2019ll be annoying to protect so maybe 4x4 or 3x3 like the clan castle. I should probably go to supercell to leave this idea but I\u2019ve already tried and could not find it. So if you\u2019re a random fan and have an account feel free to pass this on. It\u2019ll probably get rejected idk. Five out of five stars I\u2019ve been playing this game for years!Edit: maybe the Cantina can be place on the beach and they set sail to the builder base and the can stay thereNew idea!!: emotes! If we are watching our  base get raided I want to be able to laugh at my attacker for only bringing goblins and realizing that all the loot is in the storages and not in the collectors. Just a laughing king barbarian at the corner of the screen would do. Nothing in the way so I don\u2019t interrupt his attack</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 86%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 717.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#5 in Strategy"}, {"size": "183.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/king/id526656015?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Start playing Candy Crush Soda Saga today - already enjoyed by millions of players around the world!Candy Crush Soda Saga is the divine puzzle game from King, the makers of Candy Crush Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, and more!

In my previous review, I had mentioned that my Grandson is learning to play this app game with me.  I\u2019d like to provide these additional comments about my Grandson.  I have several candy crush game apps, and I\u2019m at the higher levels. I soon realized that he was \u201cnot a good loser.\u201d  He wanted to buy lots of boosters to win. I explained that he needed to learn how to play better and only use the boosters (mostly the 2 lollipops &amp; free switch) when it was possible to win.  Now we \u201creally celebrate\u201d when we win, and he has a much better attitude when we lose. He is starting to teach me some things.  My suggestion is.... I\u2019d like to receive more lollipops and free switch boosters. The other Candy Crush apps provides these booster types when you open the app or after winning a game. I know that I have accumulated gold bars, but it doesn\u2019t appear that we get many of these booster types for 20 bars. I appreciate if you would consider this suggestion. Many of us have limited means, and we really enjoy playing these apps, especially with our grandchildren.</p>|I initially gave this game 5 stars.  It was entertaining enough to become addictive.  However, as levels got harder, I\u2019ve quickly realized often times, there wouldn\u2019t be a winning combination no matter how good you can play.  And when you use objects that you\u2019ve earned to help you along, the randomness of the layout would be to such an extent that your selected help items would become useless.But the real problem I\u2019ve got with this game has to do with the so called \u201cPIGGY BANK\u201d where the gam tricks you into thinking that you\u2019re earning gold pieces that can be used to purchase helpful items.  When you reach 50 gold bars, the bank becomes full.  But those gold bars you THINK YOU\u2019VE EARNED AREN\u2019T YOURS to use...despite all those bars being shown as being deposited into your piggy bank, the second you try exchanging them for something useful, the game tries to charge you in what they refer to as \u201ccashing out\u201d your bank.  Frankly, it\u2019s a load of crap...bordering on the act of defrauding players by tricking them into purchasing gold bars that, through game play\u201d, indicated that you had already earned them.  I DON\u2019T LIKE BEING CONNED OUT OF MONEY.  It\u2019s NOT the $3.00 the game tries to get from you, it\u2019s the principle of the matter.  If you indicate that I\u2019ve earned something, then you\u2019ve got absolutely NO BUSINESS TRYING TO TRICK ME INTO PAYING FOR THAT EARNED ITEM before I can use it.

I\u2019ve not purchased any coins because I have the patience and discipline to wait for free coins, plus i have a life to live rather than wasting my days playing with fake money! It\u2019s great for passing time!!! Still plays with a humans psyche. Medusa magic is about the only game you can go to and win a lot but then somehow, whether it be an update or algorithm, you begin losing over and over. The bonus games drain your winning pot. I\u2019ve also noticed that depending on which amount you bet will determine if you are likely to have a decent winning round. For instance, if I\u2019m betting $50,000 coins over and over, odds are that it doesn\u2019t like this bet so I will reduce to $37,500 and then it keeps hitting. But then some days it likes the $25,000 over the $37,500. I understand the more you bet the more you win and vice versa. Too bad it\u2019s not real money cause I\u2019d be rich! Everyday is different but there are some days where no matter what your bet is, you lose most of the time. I was enjoying this game but the last week or so it has no been enjoyable because I\u2019ve lost millions in coins. Keep your customers happy if you don\u2019t want them deleting your app. Everyone likes to WIN more often than not! Also, two games I liked to play are gone after the update. Why? I actually thought one of them was hilarious by the sounds the different western characters made in their special rounds. Get smart...don\u2019t get greedy!</p>|If you are wondering that same thing, you\u2019re not very good at figuring out how this world works. But you know Slotomania runs on computers and you know computers cost money. You probably even know that if more people play Slotomania that means it costs more money to run those computers. So imagine you are Ruler of Slotomania, and you find out 100 people are playing your game, and that it costs you $1 each month for each of them to keep the computers running. That $100 a month you have to pay to the computer people. And lets say only 10 people, out of the total of 100, are actually buying any coins, and lets assume those ten people each buy $15 of coins each month. That\u2019s $150 you make each month. $100 to the computer people, and you get to keep $50. Not bad.But what if the 90 people who play but never pay were to stop playing. You\u2019d only have to pay $10 a month for the computers, but you\u2019d still be getting $150 from the paying players, and you could keep $140 of that, instead of being able to only keep $50. If only you could figure out a way to frustrate and anger the non-paying players enough to drive them away. You know, like making them lose more frequently and in more frustrating ways. Get it? They want to drive you freeloaders away so they can make more money!</p>|They charge you for coins you never get and when the game is spinning it starts hesitating when it looks like you might have a winning spin. You are not winning money like at a real casino and here you win less. DO NOT BUY COINS!!! You get hooked playing these games and you buy coins and you win even less. And don't even hope to play the bonus games you are lucky to get to play once in 300 spins!! What a joke. You have the bonus snakes and ladders, spent a ton and every time I get to top 3 rolls in a row hit the snake and drop. Done this 12 times what a joke your bonus games. And you get slotto cards all ones you already have. This games is a joke and I just spent my last dollar here!I had my bonus spin and when I hit collect it said I already had and did not give coins. I keep getting charged twice and now not getting coins thinking about deleting app.  6-6-16 every time you have to update the app your wins are few and far.  I have been playing even buying coins when I said I would not anymore. I have not gotten a new card or a full screen of twins.  Bought over 10 mil and only getting play got 30 min or so. Quit upgrading and making the winning less you act like you are paying  out money and your business is failing.You ask if u r enjoying big wins. I won 10 free spins and that is a big win? I lost twice as much in 5 minutes. The same even if you purchase coins. It continues to be the same  and your specials you run to win more are terrible.</p>", "four_star": "width: 19%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 62%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.2, 69.2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#16 in Casino"}, {"size": "123.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/supercell/id488106216?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Enter the Arena!

For one, you could do different styles of them, like single/double elimination brackets or black points, but you could also do different game play tournaments. Like having double elixir, sudden death, touchdown, or other tourneys.... heck, a tournament that you spend 5-10 gems for a chance to win 25-50... I find a bracket way more enjoyable, than trying to battle the same people for an hour to see who can learn the others deck better. Especially if the match up is so close that starting hand effects the out come.... but the tournaments you have now, are far better than the challenges you guys try to do.... You\u2019ll only get me to spend gems on a challenge if you\u2019re doing a national competition... then I may retry it a few times if the entry fee is only 10 gems.... other than that, I find them a joke.</p>|First off, I would just like to say that this is a great game. If you are considering downloading it, it is definitely worth trying. With that said there are a few problems that I would like to mention. The first being lag. After the last update, whenever I try to attack it takes so long to load that most of the time the battle is over by the time it has finished loading. Sometimes I just come on and have already lost a tower or have taken substantial damage. This is extremely annoying as I have lost hundreds of trophies as a consequence of not even being in the battle. This could be fixed by adding a confirmation button that says that you are ready to start the battle. Another problem is the trainers. I understand that it is complicated to make an AI that can play a strategy game like this but it is not accurate. It always uses the same deck and is really easy to beat. I would like a trainer that would give an accurate depiction of how a possible new deck would do against real players. Also, in 2v2 battles your partner sometimes deserts you. This leaves you playing a 1v2 battle without the slightest hope of winning. When this happens you should get an AI partner or at least compensation equal to a second player. With these concerns aside, the game is very fun to play (if it loads) and has pretty decent graphics. It is definitely worth having on your phone.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 84%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.7, 822.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#6 in Strategy"}, {"size": "292.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/playrix-games/id1162116447?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Welcome to Gardenscapes!

I hate that you can't earn enough coins to do anything. Are you for real, only 1 star for completing a level? And why do you charge for calling someone? That's totally ridiculous. It's quite obvious that Austin is the laziest butler on earth. In real life he would be fired. Solving the puzzles are ridiculous, the puzzles are rigged to lose, requiring you to buy coins. You earn so little you can't go on. You can't earn enough coins to buy boosters. So little reward for continuing. I have just about reached my limit, I'm sure this has been a very rewarding game for you, so I wish you the best, because I'm though with paying astronomical prices to lose. I played for a short time, longer than I intended, but now I'm through paying for constantly losing and then not being able to earn coins or rewards, without having to buy with cash the things you want. If you haven't obtained your pay for this game, it's because you have ran your players off. I come back daily to try for coins via watching apps I have no intention obtaining. As for playing the game that's out. I no longer enjoy the lazy butler. You have to earn stars just to greet the guests? Get real. You can't rehab the gardens due to having to buy ridiculous chores. You should not have to use stars to get the mail, answer the gate, train the dog, clean the pavements. I would like to build the gardens, isn't that what this game is about?</p>|I started playing Garden Escapes a few months ago! There are many challenging levels along the way. Once you learn the various tricks and techniques of using the boosters and how to combine them to get more Banff for your buck, then the levels are a bit easier to best. I've between stuck on some levels for days on end, which seem impossible to beat. Those particular difficult levels, I find that without using extra boosters they would be nearly impossible to beat. The amount of moves in any given level are few, and so is best to use each move wisely and not waste moves unnecessarily. I have purchased extra coins on occasion in order to help me \"continue\" a game for 900 coins. It's only because the average coins earned per game seems to fall in the 55-65 coin range. So... It takes a long time to earn enough coins to help make progress in the game. My one huge criticism about the game is that when you make a move on your very last turn, it will not allow you to make moves (I.e., blow up bombs, etc...) like you can when you are playing with other turns in the game- that you can make extra moves before all the blocks settle into place. That is a big annoyance that you cannot do that on the very last move- it could make a difference of winning that level. So 4.5 stars! BTW, Home Escapes, by Playrix is just as fun, and maybe even a slightly better game!</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 73%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 177.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#12 in Simulation"}, {"size": "164 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/linkedin-corporation/id288429043?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Use LinkedIn to navigate your career with confidence--whether you want to find a new job, keep in touch with your network, or stay up-to-date on the latest from your connections and your industry.Get the app to access the full features and functionality of LinkedIn--anytime, anywhere.Why you\u2019ll love using the LinkedIn app:1.

It served the purpose, put myself out there.  Now fast forward to today, I\u2019m on LinkedIn more often as I search for my next career opportunity. Still a free account, I saw the attention I was getting when applying, how often I was coming up in searches. I went ahead and got the Premium, but noticed no change in my stats that indicate it is worth the money. On a free account I would appear about 30 times a week in searches. With Premium, still 30 times a week. Knowing where I rank compared to every one else and how my skills stack up to the posted position does not add a lot of value. Nice to know, but not for $30 a month. On a side note, even when I was 10/10 on skills I still got one of those \u201cSorry, we are perusing others...\u201d. So the value of knowing where you stand isn\u2019t high.Now to the app, there are 2 things I like. The job search feature is easy to use, and great that it saves previous criteria. I also like how each tab works independently. So my homepage is where I left it, jobs page is where I left it and I can go back and forth while keeping my place. Might not seem like a big deal, until you don\u2019t have something similar.</p>|I had created and maintained a linkedin account for years, however unfortunately created my account with an email address that I can no longer access. I have tried for, I kid you not, months, to re set my email so I can maintain the hundreds of connections I\u2019ve made with this app in the past. Not only does the service crash every single time I try providing my drivers license to reset the email account, but when I finally found an email to contact linkedin directly about the problem, I have yet to receive a response. And as today when I decided to bite the bullet and create a new account, the app presents to me an \u201cerror\u201d once again and I am unable to create a new account.I am horribly disappointed at the lack of customer support and frankly find it quite ironic that a site would hinge its function on professionalism yet not provide a customer support number to call and speak to a person about issues such as mine. I am a recent graduate in a location where my field is flooded, so any app or networking site is crucial for me. Low and behold, Linkedin seems bent on skirting around issues related to their app and the customers suffering because of it.

Its goal is definitely and obviously to make money for the game developers through In-App Purchases. As a result, you can definitely have more fun playing if you have more money to spend. But unfortunately, twenty bucks worth of diamonds doesn't go as far as you'd think. I think the app developers could make more money if they listened to user feedback, and made this more playable for people who don't have $100 a month to spend. For example, if $20 bought you a lot more, you'd make it up in volume. If you got 20 instead of 5, and could trade with others, more people would play. If you had unlimited borrowing, instead of just once every four days, more people would play... and if you could borrow accessories it would be even more fun. If you could buy accessories with cash instead of only with diamonds, more people would play. The reason people submit designs that don't follow the challenge's criteria is because they can't afford to buy diamonds. Also, a way to immediately return something you bought by accident would be helpful. I'd personally love to see drapes and throw pillows added to inventory.  I really think that DH would make even more money if you could get more for your buck. They would make up in volume anything lost in other ways. Developers should think outside the box on this one!  The game feels discouraging when it gets too expensive to play.</p>|This is a very fun way to keep current in home design. The inventory\u2019s on trend and bonus points for the catalogue of info on each piece in the event you might like to purchase an item for your own  real house. I happened onto this game and took off with it kind of learning the rules, strategy of play, etc as I go. I have been playing almost a year now and spent $200 on my debit card to buy inventory. I have only received 3 scores of 5 in all my designs entered which seems extremely unfair as when I view the 5 star design winners they are no where as near as nice as my own entry. It seems to me like the voting system is off kilter, why not let real true experienced designers make the  decision on final score. That seems more like it, and would probably be helpful in keeping the character of the design patterns fresh, rather than stagnating into only a certain look getting showcased into the 5 category. One last comment, the winning designs do not seem to take into account the preview info given about the home owners goals. Often times the 5 star designs do not pay any attention to the criteria of gender of the intended occupant or style desired by owners. Therefore, a pink frilly room is able to achieve a score of 5 even though the monologue calla for designing a room for a boy occupant. How does that work when the rest of us are taking in the desired effect of each room asked for in the description? Otherwise, love, love, love this addicting app.</p>|When I downloaded this app in just December 2018 I knew I'd \u2764\ufe0f it... i was right. I play this game every day and it's addictive. And people say this app is terrible bc u have to buy diamonds to pay for the furniture... it's not true. I just stick with the usual amount of cash I have ($500-$5000) and it's fine bc not all things cost diamonds. And the limited bundles available you don't have to buy for $3. If you have enough, you can just buy the stuff from the bundles with your diamonds. However, there is one bad thing about the app that drives me crazy. It glitches CONSTANTLY. I'm not out of space, I power my device off, and I clear the in-game cache, but when I use certain items, go to certain pages, or click on certain things in the app, the whole entire app shuts down and force closes when I didn't do a thing. Please fix. It especially drives me mad when a challenge is ending and I can't log back into my room because the in-progress design I have saved for it has so many items that it can't load and it shuts down every time I log into the design. SO frustrating. Sometimes I don't even have to click on things in the app for it to shut down. Sometimes it just force closes at random. And I know it's just my design home app bc none of my other apps do this. But other than a few glitches and bugs this game is great. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in home designing. Great job Crowdstar! \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 70%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.5, 102.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#24 in Simulation"}, {"size": "258 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/funplus/id495598783?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Get ready for the next stage of warfare with the free strategy MMO Guns of Glory!

There really are no protections in place for lower players or beginning players where another OP player can demand weekly amounts of resources and either the lower player gets attacked repeatedly or just complies and the game developers reply that it is the lower players fault (their way of saying - your fault you do not pay to level up).  Honestly, the game developers/tech support are straight up rude when replying, aside other occasions they gave false/wrong information regarding trouble-shooting bugs in the game. I don\u2019t mind paying for in-app purchases to support games, but the customer support and game developers response to players is a huge turn off.  Agree with other reviewers, don\u2019t spend money on this game, it\u2019s possible to advance without it, but especially because of the poor tech support (wrong information proving costly later) and rude customer support - don\u2019t spend the money when their infrastructure is so uneven/unbalanced/uninformed support compared to other game platforms with better systems like brackets or prestige exchanges and better tech/customer support.</p>|I\u2019ve played this game for 3 months and spent about $100 on purchases. First this game is geared toward causing you to necessitate spending loads of money on gear and speed up. For example, I spent a total of $15 on scholar gems and opulence gear because it take weeks and millions of pieces of iron, wood, food and silver to move up from around castle 18. It would take someone constant attention and months to get there otherwise over castle 20. The new Sun King equipment takes 100 fragments and 1800 rare item chests not to mention thousands of other items to create. How does someone go from a castle 22 to 30 in a week? Well they spends hundreds and thousands using real cash while poor folks spend weeks to make one piece of armor. Also what totally cant stand is the attitude, bullying and general nastiness of this game. Moderators are players too and they can just be as bad. If you enjoy drama, staying on a game all day and getting wiped out constantly by folks that are bigger (there are always bigger fish waiting to kill you) and spending loads of REAL money this is the game for you. Good luck if you indulge and say good bye to many other things in your life due to this game taking you away from reality simply because you are trying to heal the 200k troops you lost because your shield went down while you were driving or you slept too long.</p>|In this game you can play with out spending, although it helps a great bit. Most of the low star comments are based on people attacking lower castles. However this is in a way false. Yes you can get attacked and lose paid for assets, but they have protective abilities that are able to be bought through in game resources and not just out of pocket. In every game they have bullies and will always be bothersome, but not as bad if you play in a strategic manner. It is a war game so thinking you can sit around and not participate like it isn\u2019t one is not a reason to be upset. Only problem I have with this game is prices for what you actually get. A bit unfair in that aspect. This should be looked at because once you hit a certain castle level prices increase and you do not get enough resources with it. Overall a good game and very fun to play. Make sure you get an alliance because it truly helps. Yes smaller ones will be targeted, but as I said many ways to protect your stuff with shields and putting resources into storage.(Stored items will not be used or able to be plundered)</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 60%;", "one_star": "width: 25%;", "star": "3.7, 5.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#33 in Strategy"}, {"size": "162.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 8%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/warner-bros/id298372283?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Power up your best dragon and fight for The Iron Throne today!

Over the past few weeks there have been numerous glitches that effect the play and flow of the game. After a day or two we get a notice saying \u201c sorry, my bad \u201c here\u2019s a couple of gold coins (300 or so)The only issue I\u2019ve ever had happened a week ago. I was about to stop playing for the day. I purchased three, 24 hour shields to protect my keep/castle. When I checked back my keep had been ransacked. I emailed the developers about this problem they immediately sent out 50k in gold to rectify the problem. The problem is that I\u2019ve been building this stuff up for months and that amount would replace a forth of what I had lost. I asked only for them to replace what I had lost. Nothing more, nothing less. I was met with a \u201c we\u2019ve had players take advantage of us in the past, so this is the way we do things now \u201c I can\u2019t help but feel ripped off. I lost things to no fault of my own and because of what someone else supposedly did I have to just take it and be happy. Tell people up front how great, fun, and challenging this game can be. Then tell them what can and will happen when things go side ways on the developers part. If I had known how this would have been, I would have never started playing this game. I recommend you think long and hard before you start.</p>|There are many things that keep me playing this game. The people I met when I started playing played a great role in keeping me coming back, day after day. The game itself and the fandom associated with Game of Thrones are outstanding. Never before have I seen anything like the teamwork and dedication found in the people who play this game. However, as I continued to play, I found many issues with the game, chief among them just how terribly buggy the game is. With every new update, some bugs are taken out, and new ones are created. On more than one occasion, I have updated the game, and couldn\u2019t play for a few days or more, because the game would shut down as soon as I booted it up. It makes me sad because I truly love this game. But the last straw for me is just how obviously pay-to-play the game is. At a certain point, the game gets so grindey, that the best option is to buy packs. I will admit, I have given into these temptations from time to time, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t feel terrible about it. I love this game, I really do. But if something doesn\u2019t change, and soon, I can see a lot of people leaving the game, and effectively killing the experience for everyone who plays. I really hope that someone important sees this, because I would like to think that my words mean something to the people who run this game. But what do I know? I\u2019m just a man.</p>|I\u2019ve been playing this game over two months and in that time the glitches have gotten progressively worse! It\u2019s super frustrating &amp; disappointing. Some of the features are fun but the best part of this game is the social aspect of meeting, communicating with people from various countries and becoming friends with some. However this is a spenders game. The resources needed to upgrade are crazy ridiculous, millions upon millions. The game would be much better if 1.the glitches weren\u2019t a daily occurrence, multiple times daily 2. You could at all times send resources to your alliance (not just with buying packs that pass gifts at random) 3. T1 of the group should be able to cut anyone at all times 4.Keeps or players should only be able to attack other players within their troops level. 5. Cut the resources needed to upgrade in half!!!! Everything costs way too much. 25 mill food and 25 mill wood plus brick ( that I had to buy), keystone, etc to upgrade a keep 19 is excessive people. Worst of all is the glitches! I\u2019ve had people in my alliance myself included that don\u2019t mind paying to advance (within reason) but not with the glitches and sample response message you get whenever you submit a ticket. My number one spender has left the game. WB really should do better to make the game more glitch free &amp; enjoyable for all whether people are spending money or not.</p>", "four_star": "width: 15%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 66%;", "one_star": "width: 8%;", "star": "4.3, 34.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#55 in Strategy"}, {"size": "170.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/episode-interactive/id761807761?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Episode lets you LIVE your stories with love, romance, adventure, and drama.

Each story I have ever read on episode wasn\u2019t a waste of time at all! All the stories were very detailed, also the storyline wants you to keep reading! The characters and quality is amazing, it brings life to the story! They feel like actual humans to me, how they move and what they wear, and their features. Though at first this game made me wait 3-4 hours for the tickets to refill which sucked! With this new update you can just watch ads to refill passes! So I don\u2019t have to wait for passes anymore! The gems are a problem that isn\u2019t really bad, but the gems is exaggerated amounts. First off in some stories you have to pay 20 gems for a outfit that won\u2019t last long at all, second I see you have to pay with gems after the next and the next, left and right, so I started reading what the community writers had to show. I think their stories are AMAZING! STORYLINE IS LITERALLY THE BEST! And I don\u2019t see me using my gems in sight, I haven\u2019t used my gems once from reading the community writers stories. So if you are planning to get this app for the first time, I recommend you read some stories with gems in them, then move over to The COMMUNITY WRITERS stories! This way you get a taste of both! After that I suggest you stick with THE COMMUNITY WRITERS STORIES! They are the best! But if you decide the ones with gems in the stories that\u2019s you, you do you!</p>|Episode is great, don\u2019t get me wrong. I honestly love it so much and I play episode almost every day. But the passes and gem situation is very frustrating. You have so many downloads, and you guys probably want to keep it that way. So if I were you, I would try putting yourself in a different position and ask, \u201cWould I be frustrated if I waited 4 hours to get 2 passes?\u201d I definitely would be. 2 measly passes after waiting for 4 hours! That\u2019s insane. Now I need to point out one thing though, they do give 4 passes every 4 hours of you continuously play episode. that seems a bit more reasonable. As I said I love episode, but maybe change it to 4 passes in 4 hours all the time, not just if u play episode a lot. Some people can be very inpatient and might just delete the app as soon as they see how long you need to wait. Also, maybe consider a thing where you can watch ads in order to get a pass?! please consider. One last thing. Some stories actually have tons of choices to choose! There\u2019s the rlly bad choice you have to choose, or the really good choice. But you don\u2019t really get to choose the one you want unless you have TONS of gems. And I mean TONS. Especially the pretty little liars. I honestly love it sm. But srsly? Almost 40 gems just to choose a good choice?! It makes me furious. Maybe have a limit for authors for about 10 gems per choice.</p>|I love the interactive stories this has to offer and their plots are intriguing as well. However it not only takes forever to get passes but the timer on it is glitchy. For example, just now I went back to the app around 6 o\u2019clock 6:30pm and it is currently 9pm. I used the rest of my four passes before 7 and it showed 3 and a half hours left but when I just checked it was telling me I still had to wait for 2 and a half hours instead of one and a half. That\u2019s an hours extra wait time. Players shouldn\u2019t have to use all four passes in order to reset the timer to earn more. It should be an hour or even half an hour for each pass with the option to watch ads (limited number per day) in order to earn more. Additionally players should be able to watch ads and earn gems, even if it\u2019s just two or three at a time because we want to be able to play the game fully. Also for whatever reason I feel super guilty when I don\u2019t do the premium option but that could just be my anxiety and lack of friends in the real world. Anyways the timer can be super glitchy and needs to be fixed as well as the opportunity to earn passes or just have a shorter waiting period. The pass timer being glitchy and awful has happened to me before on multiple occasions and I would like that to be fixed. The lack of ways to obtain extra passes and the unearned wait time really sets what otherwise is a really fun break, back two stars.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 81%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 1.2M Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#4 in Role Playing"}, {"size": "120.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/playdemic/id505151958?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The sun is shining, it\u2019s time to play the real-time multiplayer game everybody\u2019s talking about!Mobile Game of the Year - BAFTAGame of the Year 2018 - Mobile Game AwardsGame of the Year  - TIGA AwardsPlay on beautiful courses against players around the world in real-time as you compete in tournaments, 1v1 games and challenge your Facebook friends!

When I was advancing in the initial tours, I had to keep playing multiple times as I was paired with people who had 400+ trophies &amp; much better clubs compared to me. Eventually I was able to advance after I kept playing but once I finished 4 tours, it required 10,000 coins to participate every round. When I did, I was paired with opponents who had even more trophies and better clubs. After I lost, I had to upgrade my clubs. But then I had to spend my coins. Then I had to start playing those lower fours but even there I was paired with opponents who were much higher and advanced than my level. So I kept losing. I had 40,000 coins and close to 380 trophies a week back. Right now, I had 1000 coins &amp; 300 trophies. This has to improve. You just can\u2019t ask players to keep playing again and again the same tours to collect coins. You need to give them better clubs once they finish tours. They should not have to play 25 games to upgrade one club and then you also need to pair them with opponents of equal strength. It\u2019s been very frustrating to earn all those coins on your way up only to find out that it won\u2019t get you anything and in the process of getting better, you end up spending all those coins and also end up losing more games. I am giving up on this game for now. I will just wait for them to bring these changes before I get back to this game.</p>|I\u2019ve used this game for a little over 6 months now and think I have a pretty good feel for it over all.  The game a easy in the beginning - as you work your way up the ranks it gets harder - as most games do.  The graphics are awesome, play is easy and you can do moderately well without spending a dime... the pitfalls are there though - when your winning you should play play play - when you are not stop. The game obviously works with/on algorithms Like a slot machine - when you\u2019re hot you\u2019re hot - when you\u2019re not you\u2019re not.  However just because you\u2019re doing great on me level doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be successful on another during the hot steak - and vice Versa.  Be carful spending money - once you do it seems the only way to continue to improve is to spend more money - that\u2019s how they make their money though, so it\u2019s ok to donate every now and again.  Personally I\u2019d rather have paid more for the app and not have all the in game purchases.  I don\u2019t like the special balls and clubs - I\u2019d prefer to keep the game on a equal playing field for all.  I also wish putting was a little more challenging so you could upgrade putters if they are going to upgrade all other clubs.  Lastly unlocking clubs should be easier as you move up the ranks of this is the route they want you to go.  In app purchases should be a lot cheaper - a lot cheaper.   Overall the game is fun and you can do well either way and your ability to advance ultimately resides in your skill.</p>", "four_star": "width: 29%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 62%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.5, 1.2M Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#15 in Sports"}, {"size": "201.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/kabam/id445459903?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Prepare for epic versus-fighting action with your favorite Marvel Super Heroes &amp; Super Villains in the ultimate cosmic showdown!

I love this game and can still see/feel the potential here. That being said, coming from a game development background, Kabam seriously needs to be more transparent as well as fix what is STILL broken. Every update brings new things, good AND bad. Pushing the envelope is great, but pushing it while things are broken is not a good way to keep players. Recruiting is becoming hard. Players are leery of continuing. I get that keeping this thing running is tough, but many other companies(including your parent company) handle issues and player problems much differently and efficiently! You've got me as a long term player, and I know there are plenty of others out there. I want to give a 4+ review, but I can't do that until y'all fix the current issues, just listen to your players/customers.*Old: I'll upgrade my review to 3 stars. They are making progress but still have a long way to go in terms of a potentially great game.I've played this game since almost the beginning. There have been a lot of changes over the 2 years, most of them have been good for the game and balance.  HOWEVER, the 12.0 patch has literally made the game into something completely different and has so many bugs that it is practically unplayable.  I have hope Kabam/NetMarble will come to their senses and fix what they broke. Until that time, 2 stars is the best I can rate it.</p>|I have been playing Marvel Contest of Champions for about 2 years, and it is by far the best mobile game I have ever played. But as you progress further down into the meat of the game, map 5 and 6 of alliance quest and tier 3 and bellow alliance war, the game loses the fun and the wallet wars comience. With the 4th of July offers showing us that Kabam favors the big spender, shown in the all father Od\u00edn a offer where if purchased 3 time, would grant a full tier 5 basic and 2 tier 2 alpha catalysts, the minimum spenders and free to play player in the beginning stages and end game are at a HUGE disadvantage. Kabam needs to get there head in the game, and think about the community, and not how full their wallets are. As a side note, I would like to see and new 5 star crystal system added, where instead of trying for every champion, you can pay a bit more shards and specify what champions you want to try for. For example, if you want to try for one of the avengers ( Spider Man Stark Enhanced, Captain America, Hawkeye, etc) you could pay some where along the lines of 2500 to 5000 extra 5 star shards to guarantee one of those champions, instead of a trying the 10k basic pool for a less than 1% chance at the specific champ you want. All in all, Kabam has made a great game, but with the issues I have discussed about above be resolved, it would go from great, to incredible.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.6, 223.8K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#11 in Adventure"}, {"size": "149.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/smule/id290596339?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Love music?

All I can say is, there must be some very talented people (who listen to customer feedback) working for Smule Sing!... because they are constantly seeking to improve the user experience!           The pitch monitor is terrific for training your ear because it gives you instant feedback. If you are trying to really learn a song, that feedback is invaluable because you can tell (as you sing), whether you are \u201cway off,  pretty close or dead on\u201d.       What I have discovered is \u2014 most everyone is on a journey of learning to sing \u201cbetter\u201d. That is true for those who are relatively new to singing...as well as those who sing or have sung professionally. Singing well... really is a lifelong process.        One of the neat things about this community are the acquaintances and friendships which develop over time. It\u2019s not uncommon to sing with someone on the other side of the planet! That is still awesome to think about... even when language barriers present a challenge, the universal language of music bridges the gap and makes for a much more harmonious world! That should be a plus in almost anyone\u2019s book! I know it is for me.</p>|I downloaded the app because it sounded fun and I was quickly hooked. It took a little time but after joining several people, I was able to find my way to some pro level talented singers who were on the app to have fun and sing just like me. Over time, I\u2019ve made amazing friendships with people from all over the world. Smule is such a wonderful outlet for me. I check it many times a day to see who\u2019s joined me or commented on my songs. There is every style of singer on there and with the community songbook, the list of song choices is virtually endless!The ones who give this app a low rating are mostly ones who didn\u2019t stick around long enough learn how to properly use the app (always use headphones!) As for the price, you can join others as many times as you want without paying for the VIP subscription. Your options are limited on vocal and filter fx but you can still make it sound great. If you choose to pay for VIP, you can get it cheaper through Smule than through iTunes and it\u2019s well worth it. For the amount of joy I bet through the app, the subscription price is a deal!Do yourself a favor and check it out! Stuck with it awhile and you\u2019ll find a whole world of wonderful people who love to sing!</p>|I have been on this app for so many years, back to when I remember watching a million ads to be able to accumulate enough credits to purchase songs. I had built up quite a collection before things changed. I don\u2019t mind the current system all that much, but there is one particular flaw that has always disappointed me more than others. I am a huge broadway fan, and as much as I love the new musicals that are popular right now, I also have a lot of favorites that maybe aren\u2019t so current and popular. There are songs on the app, but nobody is singing them. I don\u2019t have the type of money to be able to afford a VIP subscription, so with nobody making duets there is no way that I\u2019m able to sing the songs that I want. What I\u2019m suggesting is that for songs that maybe don\u2019t get a ton of attention on the app, or at least the ones that are uploaded by Smule and not by users, there might be a way to make a permanent duet track, so that when people want to go back to older songs and sing them, they are able to even if they don\u2019t have a VIP membership like me. Thank you for your time and possibly your consideration. This is mostly just my sadness over the fact that I\u2019m not able to sing all the Songs For a New World songs that I want, but oh well.</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 78%;", "one_star": "width: 7%;", "star": "4.5, 76.2K Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#12 in Music"}, {"size": "213.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/playrix-games/id1162116447?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Never Fishdomed before?

I love the updates with the special fish, but it takes way too long to earn enough vouchers to get them. I wish you could get them the same way you get the other fish. I wish you could either go back to the old way of getting more boosters when you win levels instead of more time. I waste most of the time I win due to not wanting to play the game for 6 or 8 hrs straight. I do enjoy the challenges, but often don\u2019t have the patience to wait for days and days to win the level, so I do have bouts of \u201cpaying to win.\u201d So if you don\u2019t mind spending, you will love the game. If not, have lot\u2019s of patience, because you can\u2019t win the higher levels in reasonable time frames unless you do. For those of us players who do \u201cpay to play\u201d, it would be great if the developers would give us a thank you by periodically giving us extra boosters or diamond bonuses as a way to say thank you to those of us who are sticking with this game. I think that would be a nice perk to keep us staying in the game and not feeling too bad when we see how much $ we\u2019ve given you guys for playing. I\u2019m almost at the point of deleting the game, as I\u2019ve at times spent WAY TOO MUCH $. But overall I love this game.</p>|Overall an enjoyable game. It's one of those that you either have to be willing to play in short bursts or spend a lot of money on though. If you're not spending money, it may take a while to progress. You only get 5 lives and they take 20 minutes each to regenerate. There are also really difficult levels that require many tries to pass. Great for the challenge, but not necessarily great for the wallet or patience, depending which option you choose.For the developers regarding gameplay, I enjoy the lighting bolt challenges and the chest challenges. I do wish we could choose when to cash in the rewards in the chests though. I also feel that the game should include all bombs that you have remaining on the board when your time/moves run out. I feel like the game gyps the player by not giving you those. The fish tanks and decor items are cool. A+ on that. I don't mind having to advance levels for new decorations either, and actually think that creates a good goal/reward element, but I do wish you could buy any fish you want any time you want. I also wish there was a list available I could look at that shows all the different fish I have in each tank and their names,.</p>|After a year or so playing and on level 2024 I finally deleted this game. Enjoyed playing, didn\u2019t spend money on it very often. Just got tired of the manipulative algorithm that would have you run out of moves or time with just one move to win. Also, annoyed when I still have a few moves but game won\u2019t release the bubbles needed to finish level. So goodbye Fishdom, I won\u2019t miss you and sure you won\u2019t miss me. Also lowered my rating. The following is a previous review since I simply edited to say goodbye. Tiffer roll your eyes at this. Play this game as a way to unwind and mostly enjoy it. I spend some money on it from time to time but not much. A few times I\u2019ve almost deleted it because the game at times seems designed to make you spend money which I get, so I\u2019m patient and stay stuck on a level at times for a few days. Really irritates me when the board is completely cleared and you have a few moves left and need only one more bubble but the game won\u2019t release a bubble, grrr. Those are the times I nearly deleted. I also despise the new reward system of vouchers for designer fish. Yuck, those fish are ugly and I\u2019d rather have the old reward system back where you get power ups. Another ploy to get players to spend. I\u2019m in the 1700s on levels so been playing awhile. Maybe not much longer though if changes keep being made to squeeze me for money.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 80%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 214.5K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#78 in Simulation"}, {"size": "112.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 7%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/huuuge-global-ltd/id1222929957?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Join the world\u2019s biggest casino community with SLOT MACHINES HUUUGE CASINO.

However, after one of their new games released, I I hit a free spin bonus for 10 games and racked up over 6Billion in chips. At the end of the spins when they pay you your winnings, I did NOT receive a single credit. I also noticed this occasionally on other games but they were no big deal and not anything near 6Billion. I contacted support, several hours later they asked WHEN this happened, I told them approximately when to the best of my knowledge and they came back saying they checked the logs and saw no discrep! They also said \u201coften times people think they\u2019re not receiving their winnings but actually are lol. I\u2019ve spun  these reals over 1.1 million times during my 5 months playing, I think I\u2019m well aware of how their platform works. They did nothing and said goodbye after I told them I wouldn\u2019t spend another dollar. Perception is reality. Is there a chance I missed it? Unlikely but possible. And it seems very odd after many hours playing that other players \u201cin play\u201d have said the same exact thing as it happened. Others also agreed that its happened to them before. They need to figure this issue out because not All of us are wrong OR lying. Huuuge disappointment. One last comment, keep an eye out for their best deal, they\u2019ll try and sell you lesser deals for more money if you\u2019re in the \u201cbuy more chips\u2019 area. There are much better deals under the NEWS tab.</p>|Don\u2019t bother installing this game. The company has horrible customer service, when you report a problem they give you a rude response and don\u2019t solve the problem. You will not win near often as many other slot games out there win. If you want to buy chips you\u2019re going to pay extremely huge amount of money to get them.  And every time they do an update the game just gets worse and worse. Save yourself the time and install another slot game this one has gone totally in the trash.And you see the kind of response you get from support when you tell it like it is.  I wonder if they\u2019re playing their own game or doing any kind of testing to find out why they\u2019re getting all these complaints from their customers.  I know how to chat with my league/club members I\u2019m a co-leader and have been playing for a very long time.  Your response doesn\u2019t fix the problem.  Believe me I\u2019ve contacted customer support and I get rude responses with no resolution.  I don\u2019t know what industry standard you\u2019re referring to but your algorithms are definitely not on par with other slot games.  And it gets worse with every maintenance update.  Go out and read all the complaints on your FB page.  That many complaints can\u2019t be an indication that all is well with your app.  And what of your outrageous pricing?  You conveniently didn\u2019t have anything to say about that.  You\u2019re losing your user base quickly.  You might want to stop the bleeding before you go belly up.</p>|I can definitely say, yes the game is addicting, especially if you like to gamble. What makes me angry is that a few months back they changed everything up.  When you go into a slot, it starts your bet out with double what it was and if you spin and play at that increase, you will not win no matter how hot the slot is. It was at 100x your balance like if you had only $1,000,000, it would put you at $10,000 a spin. In order to win you have to go to at least 200x below balance if not more in order to win. They have done so much to make the player lose and on top of it all, the new games have the crappiest graphics now. I would think since they have gotten so big, they would have better graphics. I\u2019ve lost team members left and right due to all the changes. I use to enjoy the game and would spend at least $50 a week on chips. I\u2019ve even seen commercials for this app on large networks. The bottom line is, they obviously hit a home run when they created this app and we\u2019re making money off of it. If it works, don\u2019t fix it! Last comment.. when a customer contacts you for a discrepancy, why don\u2019t you offer them free chips for the mistake? Businesses do this all the time. It\u2019s not real money and you would make the customer happy so they will continue to play and spend their money.</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 61%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.2, 19.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#39 in Casino"}, {"size": "133.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/pixelberry-studios/id575608309?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "One choice can change everything!

I\u2019ve played them all! Every story is different from the next and, being a writer myself, I really appreciate all of the character development. There\u2019s no question that a lot of thought goes into the customizing, the art, the music, and the dialogues. My favorites include The Freshman (makes me feel young again LOL), Royal Romance, and the newer books like Desire &amp; Decorum, as well as Perfect Match. Once you get into it, the characters really come alive and It\u2019s hard to stop playing! I discovered Choices about a year ago, and very quickly went through all the stories. I gave them 5 stars because they\u2019ve truly mastered the art of virtual reality and I would absolutely die to work for Pixelberry someday! My only complaints are that I\u2019ve paid more than I can really afford on diamonds, and you have to wait anxiously for new chapters and books. Like someone mentioned in another review, I would much rather spend $10-$20 on the app at initial download, rather than pay as I go. Or even offering 2-5 diamonds after watching an ad instead of just 1. Heck, I\u2019d even watch more ads if it meant earning more diamonds! Otherwise, Choices is brilliant and beautifully done. I\u2019ve laughed, I\u2019ve cried, and I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself through these characters- as cheesy as that sounds. These stories are never dull, and contain a lot of twists and turns. I highly recommend Choices over any other competitor apps! Loveee!</p>|Choices, without a doubt, is the best game I have ever played. I have had it for almost a year and still look forward to new chapter being released, and reread my favorite stories. Choices\u2019s books have taught me so much about family, relationships, love, and the importance of making a choice. Our choices truly do define us, which I think is the whole message of the game if you could boil it down. Have you ever wanted to attend a school of magic? Find love in Jane Austen\u2019s England? Captain a star ship? Seek vengeance in Ancient Rome? Become a superhero? Marry a king? Fight for your crown? Or just try to survive high school? There is a book out there for everyone, I promise. However, If you only play one book series, please play Endless Summer. Inspired by the tv show Lost, this book is a tear jerking, heart string pulling, hair raising, mind bending beautiful adventure that I cherished every minute of and cannot wait to re read. Anyway, do yourself a favor and get this game. It sure changed my life. Thank you Pixelberry. p.s. Many people complain about the diamonds and yeah, I sometimes wish there were less choices that require diamonds each chapter (Across the Void is notoriously bad at this) but there are plenty of games that only have one or two diamond choices per chapter, and you certainly don\u2019t have to spend any diamonds to enjoy each book. I have never spent any real money on this game which has not hindered or lessened my game experience in any way.</p>|I really love choices in my opinion it\u2019s the best game I\u2019ve ever played! One thing though is that in the chapters of a book there are always choices and your choices cost diamonds. So say for example in the last book I was playing the choice I wanted cost 20 diamonds then the next choice within the chapter cost 30. I\u2019m not asking for each choice to be one diamond but I feel as though if there are going to be multiple choices with the chapter why make them cost so much. Considering that many people are low on diamonds I think it would be nice to make them at a reasonable price. Especially when there is more than two diamond required choices with the chapter. I also know you can buy diamonds in the store of the game but not everyone is able to do that. I just feel as though there should be some way for gain more diamonds being low on diamonds and not being able to pick the choice that cost diamonds (in some books)drastically affects many things within the chapter and book it\u2019s self. For me it makes it harder to enjoy the book and the game it\u2019s self because I\u2019m limited to what I can and can\u2019t choose because of the lack of diamonds I have. Maybe there could be a daily spin if you open the app everyday or a way you could watch as many adds as you want and revive two diamonds and a key maybe something along the lines of that. Besides that I love the game choices the stories are very enjoyable and feels like something outside of reality!</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 71%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.4, 88.8K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#7 in Role Playing"}, {"size": "79.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/tidal-music-as/id365244402?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Play and discover tens of millions of songs and videos hand curated by music experts \u2013 totally ad-free.TIDAL is a global music and entertainment platform that brings artists and fans together through unique music and content experiences.\u2022 Listen to all of your favorite musicOver 56 million tracks and over 225,000 videos at your fingertips.\u2022 The highest quality audio availableNo compromises.

I love the interface only minor things that would make it the best for music lovers. For example i find it repulsive and annoying that i have to scroll for a track or album instead of bein able to search. Im not tryna crash my whip to find Frank Ocean\u2019s album amongst the hundreds. Would b greatly helpful to change that (especially seein as how this is spose to be designed for music lovers, we have HUGE amounts of music)I also think if yall had some better playlists available. Maybe should look at ur users playlists for possible curators (wink wink)  but in all seriousness yall do suggest new albums but rarely the obscurity that most music lovers are looking for not just the chart toppers or best known content. We want things that make people say \u201cwhats this\u201d or \u201cwho made this playlist\u201dLast suggestion is this, please promote ur streaming site as a musicians playground. Bein able to find other ppl as deep into music as me would be cool. Seein what others are listening to and also bein able to connect via the various social media platforms because this is obviously for those of us who have an extreme interest in sound quality and are willing to come to Tidal to experience something greater, give us that. God bless. Great app and hope yall read the reviews.</p>|As our sound systems evolve in our cars and home - Tidal provides the platform to have both the instant access and the BEST quality session with the artists we love.  Streaming HiFI makes you that guy in college with the photo album full of CDs for road trips, get togethers and 'me time' in the car; but with Tidal you're carrying a semi-truck sized CD Catalog.  Love the option to stream or download to my device.  PLUS - the bonus content - hello 'I'm with Jay Z and Miss Beyonc\u00e9' - as the red velvet rope opens and welcomes us into private videos and exclusives.  There's 3 choices - #1 be someone who doesn't include music in their life - #2 spend hundreds and hundreds per year to have a tiny sample via disc of what's out there - or #3 be a Tidal Member and carry virtually the ENTIRE World of Music with you with 'equivalent or better (MQA) than CD quality'.   Funny that not many people mention the TIME a Tidal Membership saves you - you can scarf down as much content as your heart desires without scouring shelves and the Internet to find 'your jams' or even searching for deals and discounts'.  Wanna know when your favorite artist is coming - easy - ask your friend whose a Tidal Member - cause we got you - we heard the announcement and ticket release date first!</p>|I started selling high end audio equipment back in the 90s, to me the popularity signaled the end of the high end audio Industry and the backlash of consumers against record companies for producing and supporting music distribution mediums that wore out, or scratched easily. I should have known better that people would help move file based music into the hi-fi so many of us cling too. Supported by this trend, I signed up for Tidal with a hi-fi account. The sound quality does come through, and my Oppo application usually works with Tidal, that about where my satisfaction with Tidal ends. First UX, what year is it? Offline sorting, display of albums, vs artist and general navigation smack of early 2000s expect the availability of modern program languages reveal either the incompetence of Tidal\u2019s product team or they have outsourced their UX to a bank. Customer support is impossible to contact. The last time I tried, their wasn\u2019t any authentication between the app my account and their ticketing system, so each time I wrote a ticket and submitted it, I got a message saying I wasn\u2019t authorized. I unsuccessfully emailed and took to Twitter, none of the channels replied. What a dismal and useless waste of money. I consider this a major management failure. Good luck, when you are selling for pennies on the dollar refer to this review.

About 6 months ago a company I was working for sent me an invite to Dropbox to share files and join the team. The company did not like DP's service, so cancelled their business account and along with it - Dropbox locked me out of my personal account. I emailed support asking for them to give back me access to my personal account, which I had been using for many years separately from the business account I had joined. Support informed me they are unable to do so without permission to reactivate account from the business admin of the group I joined. My admin immediately emailed them to approve the reactivation, upon which DP said they can no longer reactivate my personal account due to the fact that the business account was deactivated over 30 days ago. I am completely livid - I have lost thousands of dollars in potential music licensing because my only access to my files were through dropbox. I cannot understand how my personal account, with extremely important files on it, that I've had AND PAID FOR now for many years would get deleted and deactivated just because an outside business group had decided to share files with me. I even paid for a year in advance and am paying for my account to not work!!! Customer service has not been helpful at all and I need a solution ASAP.</p>|After the recent update, DropBox stopped working properly for camera-roll upload on my iPad. Their solution? Remove the app, forget the network, fully restart the iPad, re-connect to the network, and re-install the app. Seriously? Good thing I have nothing else to do ... oh, wait. Basement flooded. So yeah, I have something else to do that's rather urgent. Good news is that yes, this did in fact resolve the issue, but really, I have other things to do in my life than reset apps with updates that fail. Especially when paying $75/month for the business version. For $75 a month I expect a MUCH better UI, amazing support, in-file search (not just the file titles), and so much more. Instead, we get the un/re-install merry-go-round, an ok UI, low-availability support (US normal business hours only), and an amazingly klugey sync setup. Heaven help you if your Mac has an external drive. What happens when you get a new Mac? It downloads everything from Dropbox again, even though all I did was remove the USB plug from the old machine to the new. Good job, Dropbox. Well done. Now I gotta wait for 4T of data to re-synch. Their super awesome support response? Well, we told you external drives might not work as expected. I\u2019m totally looking for another service. Seriously, $900 a year for this?

I take my hat off to small giant for this game. The game play is just right for a mobile device. It\u2019s got enough flavors of puzzle, rpg, and world building to keep you involved. The story is campy and silly, but that\u2019s fine, he game never pretended not to be a little silly\u2014and I like that. There\u2019s little bits of humor everywhere if you look. I\u2019ve been playing for going on a year and change now. Still have stuff to do and hero teams to build.You also don\u2019t have to spend money to succeed, at all. It helps, sure, but there\u2019s no gating with money, just increases your odds of getting good stuff if you have more chances at the hero lottery, so to speak.It\u2019s also the only mobile game that does group team building right for the small screen. Prepping for wars and strategizing how to win as an alliance of 30 some people has been the best part for me. Reminds me of when I used to have more time for games like WoW. Sure you don\u2019t get the full immersion, but still get some of the feels with this little game. My only beef is what a lot of folks complain about, the raid system seems super unbalanced and is downright annoying at times. But, it\u2019s apparent small giant are always working their butts off to tweak it, so hats off to them again for that. Also, this game is not for the impatient. Strategy is the log game sometimes.</p>|I do like playing this game, I have been playing awhile and check on my empire frequently. Maybe too much. I especially like the match game twist, it\u2019s a bit more engaging than an idle RPG. There is always a new mission or quest to complete. Titan to gang up on, Heroes to level up, or something to build or upgrade. It is very much a long term game, not for the impatient instant gratification types. I dare say you are better off not shelling out a lot of money for better heroes. If you take the slow steady approach you will have the ascension items before you need them most of the time. If you buy heroes you will end up having to wait for items to strengthen them far too often.   If I were to make one complaint it would be how the raids are handled. Never mind your team power score, or even the multiple times they have revised how they are calculated, they have little bearing on your ability to win raids. It all comes down to how many special attacks you get off. Who ever makes the most special attacks, wins. Special attack energy is almost always slanted. The winner typical makes two to three attacks for the losers one. There will be seasons where it\u2019s slanted in your favor, other times it will be slanted against you. Those rare times you are equally matched a raid can last upwards of 30 moves or more.  If there were not rewards for engaging in raids, I wouldn\u2019t bother doing raids. It\u2019s that much of a nuisance.</p>|A needlessly elaborate schematic designed to confuse you into thinking you can play for free. Quickly gets too hard to do so. But more than the standard and expected money grab is the baffling added difficulty thrown at you to actually *play* the basic puzzle game. Upgrade a web of buildings in a long linear series to Recruit heroes to train heroes up levels to ascend heroes of five different types. With taking days to move each step. Why stop your gamers from playing?  1 star not for the money grab but the inane thoughts in the \"boardroom\" that this style of play is likeable by those that play puzzle matching games.Speaking of money grabs though.  This developers here are masterclass. You can (and will) pay hundreds of dollars (I have spent close to 1000 on this game) buying *chances* to get what you need. And the chances are (not surprisingly) near zero. Exact chances?  Guess.  And you won\u2019t have to guess who figured out that in their boardroom?  You will be laughed at in that boardroom. Key items are kept from you from fully ascending you heroes though which can\u2019t be bought. Ascending them *if* you get lucky and pay money is amazingly difficult at higher levels with months of grinding (during which time you will be spending more money). Honestly this game makes you wonder why anyone would deal illegal drugs. Here the developers have found something more profitable, zero material cost and somehow legal.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.7, 30.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#34 in Strategy"}, {"size": "372.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bandai-namco-entertainment-inc/id352305770?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The best Dragon Ball Z battle experience is here!

If there is something you don\u2019t particularly like about the game, it will probably be fixed in the next upcoming months. Yet another great aspect is you can play the game how you want. The game when it comes to gacha\u2019s, the accessibility for free to play is out of this world. With the alleged 200 average dragon stones you get monthly it\u2019s still enjoyable even after you complete the main story. Or if you want, you can spend money on this game. Which brings a whole new kind of game and competition with introduction of the dupe system. I recommend if you\u2019re wanting to get into this game, get a couple of friends and compete with each other. I always found it easier to keep going that extra mile knowing I might me left behind by my friends. Another thing is that there\u2019s the option to refill stamina with dragon stones. Like most gacha games you\u2019ll have some sort of energy to stop you from frying the game-play, but I feel like Dokkan gives you the option to stop when you want. Just the overall flow of the stamina sometimes just feels like you\u2019re in control of what you want to do, or complete. Overall this game is perfect for the average mobile player, and can be easily be added to your inventory of games on your phone.</p>|Let's start out with the only bad thing here. It's Pay to win. Now that that's out of the way. Let's talk about all the good this game has to offer. Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle is a unique game with a very unique twist on the usual beat em ups. This is refreshing to say the least since most of us Dragon Ball fans are used to that formula for those games and the mechanic can either make or break the game. You collect these orbs that let you obtain ki for your ki meter that can be seen whenever you fight something. This game also comes with it's own story mode, can be completely f2p if the person so chooses (which is still viable to this day), and new things are added all the time. Sure, you can empty your purse of money into this game to get rare characters you want, however, the game already gives you plenty of dragon stones (this games Gotcha currency). Each of the story missions give you three stones and there are almost always events that give you special missions to gain more stones. I'd say it's worth it to grind a bit and earn a bit. It makes the experience of the game more genuine and fun. As a player myself that has trash luck, you can always make the best of your situations. That's why there are so many ways to play this game. And it's still being updated and modified! In my opinion, this is one of the best Dragon Ball games of it's time. Just look past that stamina issue...</p>|Can we please please please please please have the ability to sort by link skill! Great updates added and love the new summon animation!  Thank you! Love this game!  The character card art is impressive.  The gameplay is fun and interactive.  I think you should be able to search by link skill because there are so many characters and so many skills.  I am new to the series and game and love both but it\u2019s a learning experience at the same time.  Also, add a 4x speed for battles.   Keep up the good work!  Great game that doesn\u2019t force you to spend your paycheck to play and advance!! Thank you!  Also, when you have to spend stones to summon character cards. The N and R character types should be omitted.  They should be relegated to the friend summons.  It should take less awakening medals to awaken the characters.  70, 77 etc is a lot especially when you have to wait to get them and you don\u2019t always get them during game play and your STA gets eaten up really quickly trying to obtain the crazy number of medals needed.  I can\u2019t play certain challenges because my guys are not strong enough and I can\u2019t get them leveled up.  I\u2019ve been playing for almost three months and I only have one LR character and he was hard to level up!  You should be able to sort by Link Skill.  Also, you should be allowed to name your teams so you know why you created them.

I can\u2019t figure out how to get to my favorite artist-based station (can find artist in search, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a station option anymore?) can\u2019t find the Recently Played Songs list once I\u2019m playing a station. It\u2019s fine to change things, but not in such an extreme way that it appears so nonsensical to even fairly on-top-of-things users that they can\u2019t easily find the features that are important to them. I don\u2019t know if it was a web app before, but it must be because I don\u2019t recall downloading an update and everything is just a little off, not polished and smooth like a native app would be. I expected that sort of thing on a minority platform like WP, but it\u2019s really disappointing to have a worse experience on a brand new iPhone. Anyway, this app is in need of some major organizing/UI changes before it can match the user experience of previous versions. If I have to put in hours curating my stations (which looks like the direction this is going), as opposed to having a variety of stations that are good, just need minor tweaks to be great, I\u2019d might as well use Pandora!</p>|I would have given it a five star BC I simply love being too listen to my home rock station when I'm working BC I work out of town most of time. But for some crazy reason lately it has started at 100% volume, even just now I got a head start on it and began working it down to about 60 % for it just to jump right back full blast even though I was holding down on volume button. Now I really can't explain how out why it would be turning down and almost to the half mark just for it to jump to the full volume while I'm still holding on the volume but this is not some thing that I can take or tolerate at 615 am nor will my boss's or work mates at this time in the morning and hell it could give some one a heart attack when u go from nor hearing a thing where a needle could be able to be heard hitting the floor. But you could say every one is awake today after this Bluetooth box going off. Please let me know what could and out can be done and if it's anything to do on my part in really sorry for not given the extra star but I had the volume working down for it to start over. Thanks and please have this fixed or fixed for me. Have no complaints about anything else so everyone download this app and listen to your favorite tubes so day and all the time for free.</p>|I never write reviews, yet HELLO! Here I am. I have a 30 minute drive home from work to listen to what I want. Today I decided it was a great day for A Day to Remember. I switch on my beloved (not so beloved anymore) iHeartRadio app to listen to ADTR, instead Theory of a Deadman starts playing. Okay, that's fine, that was the last station I listened to. I get it. I search \"A Day\" and BOOM!! iheart already knows what I want, by automatically pulling up ADTR. I click it and wait. And wait. And wait some more (not patiently might I add) it doesn't do anything but load. I get annoyed enough to exit the app and go back in hoping by doing that it might ACTUALLY help. LOL JOKES ON ME. Theory starts playing again. I search ADTR and click it and again it continues to load. I went back to Theory and it plays a Shinedown song, okay, I'll listen to this. Maybe after a full song plays I can try ADTR again. I go back to the search and find my station, and guess what?? If you said IT LOADS WITHOUT EVER PLAYING A SONG, you would be right. My whole 30 minute car ride was one Shinedown song and a whole lot of loading and annoyance. I'm over you iHeartRadio, more like iBreakHeartsRadio. I'm going back to Pandora, they may have commercials, but at least they don't force me to listen to Theory of a Deadman. It's been real, it's been not so fun, but Thanks for the Memories (subtle Fall Out Boy reference.) \ud83d\ude44</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 69%;", "one_star": "width: 7%;", "star": "4.4, 69.1K Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#6 in Music"}, {"size": "162.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/spotify-ltd/id324684583?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Spotify is the best way to listen to music and podcasts on mobile or tablet.

What\u2019s the point of notifications or even following people if the person doesn\u2019t even receive the notification?  Additionally, it\u2019d be nice to be notified when your favorite artists come out with new music. Also, I think the app should allow you to change the playlist picture and profile picture just as it does when you\u2019re using a computer. I also wish you could add complete albums to your playlist instead of having to manually click on every single song and add it to your playlist. It\u2019s just a waste of time. And it would be so useful if you could search up a song on a playlist instead of having to look through the entire playlist to find it. Another annoying thing is when showing you \u201crecommended songs\u201d and it shows the exact same songs each time. If I\u2019m refreshing the songs, obviously I don\u2019t like them and want new songs to be recommended to me. Lastly, I would like if you could see all the songs that an artist made when first looking at their profile. It shows you their albums, but doesn\u2019t even show you their singles without you having to actually look for them yourself and it just makes it harder to find songs when it could easily be fixed by just adding their singles too. Overall, great app tho.</p>|why cant you see how many songs are on playlists anymore? or the followers it has? where is the \u2018go to album\u2019 thing on the song info? why isnt the song playing off a playlist highlighted in green so you can find it to delete it anymore? why cant you search for songs on playlists anymore? guess i have to scroll through my 500+ song playlist and find the one i want to delete manually because who cares right? i dont have other stuff to do? why change the entire format of the app only to take away functions/info from how it was before? and whats with the ads you cant \u2018X-out\u2019 of or minimize? i was trying to manually look for this song i wanted to delete and had to witness with my ears and eyes the napa auto parts parody of jukebox hero, a beloved classic. the artists section used to just play the songs by the artists that were saved, now theyre just a random list of songs not curated by the user. not only that but why cant you add entire albums to playlists anymore? \u201ceasier to make playlists\u201d huh? plus my app froze trying to open that big playlist which never happened before. I appreciate the previews coming back but all this stuff that was taken in the last update doesnt make up for it. introducing new features doesnt make people like the app when the stuff they were used to goes away.</p>|The app is actually really great, and I enjoy using it. But, there are many things that are very annoying to handle on this app. They have taken away things many of us were used to and added new things to \"make it better.\" They expect us to be happy about the changes they made, but instead see people complaining about the changes. When I first got this app it was very confusing to use, and I had to literally sit on my bed and figure out how to work it. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice app, but I feel like they weren't organized about the setup of the app and now this is causing issues for other users. By now I've figured out how to use the app better, but from time to time it messes up. Also, what's this about playing songs I don't have in my playlist? Um, \"recommend songs\" from an app that clearly doesn't know what type of music we enjoy because the music played is nothing like the music I like. It's just random songs plucked out of different playlists or something like that. And I get that they want to give you more songs so you don't have to look for them, but its songs that I didn't pick artists for. I just don't understand this app sometimes, but overall it's a pretty good app for music. But, other apps like Pandora or SoundCloud are very good and in some ways better, but that's just my opinion.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 87%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 5.7M Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#1 in Music"}, {"size": "240.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/phantom-efx/id310624343?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Spin slots and put Lady Luck to the test!

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened over time but it\u2019s no longer fun to play when you can\u2019t get any bonuses, no big wins and end up losing all of winnings faster than you win anything. The games are great games but it feels impossible to win anymore. Every update says your making improvements and making it more fun for the players. I keep hoping to find truth in this and therefore keep playing giving you the benefit of the doubt. At one point I had over a billion coins. Now I can\u2019t keep it over a hundred million. I\u2019m very sad bc I feel like I\u2019m going to have to delete this app soon. I can\u2019t afford to keep buying coins and not seeing any payoffs in return large enough to keep me interested or keep me wanting to play. It\u2019s not fun when you play a game for hours and don\u2019t hit one bonus or large win in all that time.    Also, the prizes for getting \u201cbig wins\u201d really aren\u2019t worth much. Come on guys, start giving back to your loyal players who have been with you for the long haul and faithful, daily players. I don\u2019t mind buying coins once in awhile but when I have to buy more than I\u2019m winning, I might as well be spending my money on a real casino app where I have a chance to win real money back. This is suppose to be for fun. Where\u2019s the fun??? What happened to the fun and excitement of this app that made it the best free casino app at one time?? Disappointed is all I can say.</p>|Let me first start by saying that I am at level 463, I\u2019ve been playing this game and purchase coins every few days. Over the Christmas holiday, I purchased a larger than normal coin package and also bet higher than usual. While in the Wizard game(betting 10 million a hand) I won a jackpot of 1.8 Billion, which if added to my account would have put me at over 3billion coins. The coins didn\u2019t add to my account so I immediately contacted support with a full description of what happened. Shortly there after I received an email response that they had received my ticket and after their investigation they would respond accordingly. A week or so went by and no response, they did however respond to my second request on another issue (double charging). I send a second request with no response this morning I filed a THIRD request for a follow and was told that unless I could provide a screen shot, there would be no further inquiry into my ticket. How do you screenshot the failure of coins to be deposited on a winning? If the game is still going? I have bought a significant amount of coins and as another reviewer wrote the winnings are few and far between. (Haven\u2019t won a jackpot since that day) I guess Jackpot Party got big and now they\u2019ve forgotten the very people that made them big.</p>|Slots are varied and fun, but extremely pricy for those who purchase packages for credits. I have been playing for years. Another good thing: very few glitches. Many other sites have constant issues. My problem arose with a recent $60 package for 750,000,000 credits. During a high stakes bonus round, the game glitched and on spin 5 of 20, just vanished. I wrote and asked for a refund or the 750,000,000 credits. On spin #5, I was already at 70,000,000 credits and I was placed #1 to win the high stakes tournament. When I returned to the game, I was no longer even in top 3 and I\u2019d lost even the credits I had won. I received a response almost immediately: Nope, we can\u2019t give you a refund or restore your original credits,  but here is 100,000,000 credits. I responded, that isn\u2019t satisfactory, and re-explained what had happened. No further response. Zilch. When we purchase packages, we have to trust that customer service will be responsive and take responsibility for glitches in game programming. Their initial response, then complete lack of follow up, was extremely disappointing. $60 for gameplay in which is it not possible to win any actual money ... it is realistic to expect they will take better care of their paying customers. I will never again play this game.</p>", "four_star": "width: 22%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 68%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.5, 61K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#38 in Casino"}, {"size": "129.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/soundcloud-ltd/id336353154?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "SoundCloud is the world's largest music and audio streaming platform \u2013 180 million tracks and growing.

My music was always there and it was just perfect. But recently I\u2019ve noticed that my playlists will occasionally removed themselves from being saved offline which is frustrating because I\u2019m then unable to listen to my music on my ride to work without using data. Also recently the app has been crashing very frequently. If I\u2019m driving and listening to my playlist, it will just crash right in the middle of a song and the app will close itself. This is also very frustrating because I can\u2019t very easily open my phone to start playing my playlist again while going 60mph down the highway. This app used to be perfect and used to work flawlessly. I dont know what happened. I would really appreciate any type of fix to these issues because I do not want to switch to another music app. However if these issues don\u2019t get solved I may have to.Edit: I deleted and reinstalled the app and so far everything is working as intended. Apart from that period of inconvenience this is an amazing music app. 5 stars for sure.</p>|Sound cloud is a very good application are use it every day to play my favorite tracks but here are just a few suggestions that could make sound cloud even better: you should be able to listen to all the tracks and no previews but there should still be ads because how else are my favorite artists going to make money? Also when users first Download and open the application there should be a to tutorial on how to play music, how to create playlist, how to post tracks, how to customize your name, how to follow people, and lastly how to Customize your profile picture because I still can\u2019t figure out how to do those last three things. And finally when you click on the three dots next to a playlist one of the things that pop up should be added to another playlist because when I was trying to create a playlist of all my music(combine all my playlists I had to sit there for two hours straight trying to get music on the other playlist and then I decided to give up and I still had about 1000 left lol. And I still haven\u2019t finished. Also users should be taught how to comment on tracks and sound cloud polls so you can connect with your favorite artists! I hope the makers of SoundCloud see this review and add these minor things so Soundcloud can be way better! :-)</p>|So I\u2019ve been using this app for the past 3 years and it has been amazing, but somethings I would wish could change as well as some issues I\u2019ve ran into. The first thing is the UI, if I type in a song and I spell it wrong I wish it could put up something close to that and not say \u201c No Results\u201d. Second thing is that I wish when you went into your saved playlist that you would start at the bottom or the newest song and not the top, but those I can live with so I own an IPhone X, I\u2019m not showing off or anything but this thing has amazing speakers and for some reason when I play a song it crackles and pops which is soooo annoying, I\u2019m an audio geek and I can not listen to a song when it cracks and pops it\u2019s just infuriating. And the last thing is something that I\u2019ve wanted for so long is to be able to post songs from your phone because not all of us own computers, and or laptops but the option to be able to post songs from your phone would be awesome. I hope you bring these ideas in consideration and hopefully are able to fix that bug but anyways I love this app and this is the only way to listen to songs that are posted by non singers or artists.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.5, 59.8K Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#3 in Music"}, {"size": "2.8 GB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/naturalmotion/id330281898?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "CSR Racing 2 \u2013 This game redefines what you thought possible on your mobile device!\u201cSo real it hurts\u201d \u2013 CULT OF MAC\u201cObliterates the line between console and mobile graphics\u201d \u2013 POLYGON\u201cCSR Racing 2 is visually stunning\u201d \u2013 GAMEZEBOSetting a new standard in visuals, CSR2 delivers hyper-real drag racing to the palm of your hand.

The story line is great as well as the cup races. The live races are awesome. That\u2019s where it gets addicting because after 15 wins you get silver keys which if you get to 50 you can get a star leveled car. And you never know what you will get. I have 15 cars (I bought silver keys) lol. The upgrading and tuning is an awesome plus. My suggestion to newcomers. Get in a crew. You get a boat load of bonuses and prizes. I\u2019d like to see a section where you can trade or sell vehicles to other players instead of just selling a $450,000 car for like 2k that\u2019s just a waste! I really look forward to future updates and hopefully take my idea into play. Also there\u2019s gotta be an easier way to earn golden keys instead of buying them? Maybe make a race section for that ? I don\u2019t know. But other wise it\u2019s a great game. Totally recommend downloading!Update; I\u2019ve been having trouble connecting to live races. It says it\u2019s unable to connect to network. I\u2019m not the only player experiencing this problem a couple of my friends and my step dad have experienced this also. Please fix ASAP !!  Update 2; Since new update my game is very laggy and also when revving and I take off and my rpms go all the way down making me lose a tremendous amount of speed</p>|First and foremost, this game is awesome. The graphics, the cars and the competitiveness, all amazing. The majority of my phones usage goes towards CSR. If you see me all in my phone, I'm probably playing CSR, but that's gonna have to end very soon. Between the crates giving the same cars (A45 - WRX) or just T1 cars, strip downs rewarding the same parts (it took 11 Fiat 500's to get 1 uncommon body fusion...I need 3 more body fusions) , Jess needing a mute button, and the constant live  race crashes, I'm not sure which pushed me to this point. I don't write reviews but I really loved this game. I had no problem giving it my time and my money (which took time to get), but I feel like it's a waste now. I can't enjoy this game anymore. I'd grind hours on this game because it was fun and I felt like I was making progress. However, I feel like that's why I get the same stuff now, because you want me to keep grinding, get annoyed, and pay. But for most of us, the opposite happens. Why would I pay for cars that I can buy with provided in game currency (credit/gold)? Are ALL the normal cars really in the silver/gold crates? Why would I buy bronze keys to get parts by the same 5 manufacturers or 12k credit which I could get myself in less than 10 seconds? Why won't Jess shut up? I've been playing long enough to not need her in my face about fusion parts and upgrades. Where is RNG really R? Where are the decent crate drops? Where is the love?</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 85%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 308.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#4 in Racing"}, {"size": "66.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/anchorfree-inc/id309076084?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Hotspot Shield VPN Proxy is the world\u2019s most trusted security and privacy app. Protect yourself from cyber threats with a simple tap of the screen.

In Shanghai and Qingdao I needed to use the VPN for accessing any websites, translator apps, etc. that I could normally from home. It took me at least 10 minutes to get it to work every time, closing and restarting the app, trying from different servers *if* it connected, and often being told I had no internet (with three full WiFi bars) or that they were diagnosing problems &amp; to try again later... which still didn\u2019t work after 24 hours. Overall I was lucky if it even worked at all, let alone for longer than 5 minutes. It would often drop me from my WiFi as it \u201cconnected\u201d, repeatedly, and caused me to go back through the whole process mentioned above every five minutes (or less!) I had success with this VPN only twice for 30 minutes; but it was hell to get it there. To think I payed $13 for this kind of hassle. What a waste.</p>|This works a majority of the time, with some minor issues that you can fix yourself if needed.Sometimes the VPN takes forever to connect, or secures your LTE/3g connection instead of the WiFi, even when you\u2019re connected to the WiFi. Other times it secures the connection, but the download and upload are extremely slow and never improve. If any of this happens, usually a reinstall does the trick.One other issue is when you walk away from the WiFi you have secured, it usually glitches out the app and your network in general. It usually fixes itself, but if not, a reinstall or network setting reset fixes this issue.One thing I\u2019d like to see with this app is a way to cancel a connection you\u2019re attempting. Sometimes I accidentally reconnect after disconnecting and I have to wait for it to reconnect again before I can get out.</p>|When it works this VPN barely hits my performance and I trust their payment model enough to believe they aren\u2019t selling my data. That being said, the VPN itself is so unstable I wonder how much security I\u2019m actually gaining. Two issues here: 1) The VPN randomly drops connection when online, and though it resets, I am obviously losing VPN status which I assume allows the sites I\u2019m visiting to log my IP and activity while it\u2019s down.2) It\u2019s hard to turn off. There are obviously circumstances where a VPN isn\u2019t needed or desired, especially a free one. However, when I try to turn it off, this VPN often switches back on by itself and I cannot get it to remain off. In fact this is my second download. I deleted it the first time to see if that would fix the issue. However I see that I\u2019m not the only one having that issue.Pro tip: don\u2019t rely on this if you have something truly sensitive flowing over your traffic.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 78%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.5, 91K Ratings", "category": "Productivity", "sub_rank": "#4 in Productivity"}, {"size": "179.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/product-madness/id525894639?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Experience the thrill of REAL Vegas casino slot machines \u2013 for FREE!

ANYTHING MADE BY THIS COMPANY, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY INNO TIME.. ITS CALLED GREED!!!!</p>|With the concerns that families are experiencing with their children spending so much time with video and chance games ( those at level 12), the question involves: How are children rewarded?Are they rewarded with money\u2014at this level, could they be rewarded with time spent with a designer of games for the reward?  With my experience in playing, a small success jumps me to a new game. I never get the feeling that I am succeeding so if I don\u2019t go to a higher level, I get the opinion that I am not being successful if I don\u2019t continue my competitiveness. For school-age children, shorter games with a learning focus reward being winning time to have a telephone call from the designer asking questions about how the game was designed and getting feedback from the student as to what he liked best.There are greater rewards than money-good rewards could come from having a student name a charity he would like to win for-this would build great social and skills of responsibility to help build rapport with friends rather than just competing.</p>|I've played many of these types of apps. It is consistent with all that you gain enough chips to get you started but unless you \"pay\" for additional chips you lose the few you've won VERY quickly. So the people who made the game are happy for you to waste your day if you feel like it logging in and saving \"bonus\" free chips every half hour. It's ridiculous. You have to expect to lose every time you log in and play. Once in a very long while you'll get enough to say \"yay I have chips\". After that it's back to the grind. It is like having two jobs and they become unbearable to play. The game makers prefer constant new players instead of retention. If they would make the game worth playing and allow you to win and win and win then lose maybe it would change. But this game like thousands of others is a waste of time. Play to talk with friends and that's about it. Oh yea 2/3 rds of people think this is a dating site it is not. And keep your children off there are perverts and language etc. your an idiot parent if you let your kids play or use your children's pictures.

I\ufe0f have had to buy coins almost every day do to no winnings. I\ufe0f rotate between all of the selection and I\ufe0ft seems to not help. In the beginning I\ufe0f was winning and now 6 weeks in I\ufe0f can\u2019t get my purchased coins to even last a day which stinks. Also I\ufe0f wish there were more of a selection of games to choose from. The ones you have I\ufe0f do like I\ufe0f just wish there were a few more. Although I\ufe0f have noticed you have been adding some new ones recently which I\u2019m happy about. Although the newest ones are the ones I\ufe0f never win on. Really the Cashman two games are the only ones I\ufe0f seem to do better on. But just playing those two do  get boring. But besides that I\ufe0f do enjoy this app.Update....So I love all the new games you have added. It\u2019s been really fun playing them but unfortunately I have to say out of all the casino games that I play this one costs me the most. It\u2019s extremely hard to win and its almost every day in having to buy more coins. Not to mention you should have bigger amounts for the prices. I stopped playing here for a few months hoping it would be better when I came back. The first two weeks it was and now I\u2019m back to constantly putting out $$$$ and a decent amount which is frustrating.</p>|This app is by the same developer as Heart of Vegas.  As with that game, it is lots of fun to play and has great games and graphics. For that, they are the best apps available.  Sadly, as with HOV, in the beginning it gives you lots of coins and bonuses and you almost can't lose on the spins. Once you establish a pattern of playing, the honeymoon is over and you are stuck waiting for your hourly bonus, or buying coins to play (and believe me, I have).  I know Product Madness is in business to make money, but they could at least set the reels to let you win ONCE in a while.  The bonuses drop to nothing and you are lucky to get a handful of spins out of them.  So be patient--if you don't play for several days and collect your little bonus every 15 min. (if you have nothing else to do), you can save up enough coins to play for maybe 10 min.  I think they hire only techno geeks who have psychology degrees to create the pattern of the games.In response to developer:  keep your bull to yourself.  Your canned and syrupy responses are ridiculous.  Your games are a ripoff and that's the bottom line.  People spend good money to buy coins to play your games and you minimize and disregard their doing so with your stupid defense of the fact that you set the games against people.  While trying to make us look stupid, you prove that you absolutely are jerks</p>|So I\u2019ll start with the good which is the app has a lot of the same games you play at the casino which is really nice. Aside from being able to play your favorite games that\u2019s where the fun ends. I\u2019ve read several reviews on here and everyone has the same complaints. You can never win on this app. I decided to spend money and buy coins which i don\u2019t normally do on any app. As soon as I bought coins they realize they have someone on the hook who will spend money so then you lose at an even quicker rate with the hope you will continue to spend more money to line their pockets. I bought coins several times back to back to back which I\u2019m embarrassed about now since I was ripped off so good. It\u2019s sad that this app takes advantage of people who are just looking for entertainment.

To give you a reference point I\u2019ve invested 200$ and approximately 2 hours per day for 2 months of my time and I have a level 24 castle and decent tier 3 troops. I\u2019d say with the investment I\u2019ve made I\u2019m probably in the top 20 % of players if I had to guess based on what I see. I think to get to a level 25 castle and have decent tier 4 troops your talking either another 3 to 4 months of playing or paying another 50$ plus 1 more month of playing if I had to guess. To put things into perspective my \u201c might \u201c which is a strength system this game goes off of is 11 million. This \u201c might \u201c level represents the culmination of all your armies, building levels, resource gathering capabilities etc..combined to spit out a might number. I run into people regularly with over 100 million might that could literally kill me with the flick of a finger and I\u2019m pretty strong. So I guess what I\u2019m getting at is yes the game is fun but if you want to be at a competitive level and actually have fun playing... you\u2019re looking at spending at least 250$ to 300$ and a few months to get to that level. I\u2019d say if I spent zero money it would of took me 2 years to get where I\u2019m at now.. at least 2 years. So either be prepared to spend money or be prepared for the long haul just know what your getting your self into.</p>|This is just like playing game of war, except with a slight twist and better graphics.  A little more captivating game play that will keep you engaged while you're waiting to start new constructions or researches.  Although I'm sure it's not much different than playing game of war; in the fact you'll more than likely have to drop thousands of dollars if you want to win and actually stand a competitive chance against people who obviously see money as no object.  It'd be a nice surprise to one day see a game like this, which doesn't allow in-app purchases.  Where those on top or in the lead, got there by their skill level and intelligence; not by their ability to drop more money than the disadvantaged.  In essence, all this really is, is the battle of people's egos, and who can and who will throw way the most money; for the pointless cause of only making the game developers rich.  It's a bit sickening when you think about it.  All of the troubles, sorrows and sufferings in the real world, and we have people willing to dump thousands into a fake fictitious world; all just to boost and inflate their egos really.  It's a fun and entertaining game though.  At least until you get to the point where you will not be able to defend yourself from basically becoming a resource farm for the \"elites\".</p>", "four_star": "width: 16%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 65%;", "one_star": "width: 10%;", "star": "4.2, 33.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#18 in Strategy"}, {"size": "428.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/scopely/id305003647?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Roll dice to play YAHTZEE\u00ae With Buddies!

You can play one turn at a time with strangers, which can be a very time-consuming endeavor. If you want to play a game by yourself (against the computer) you have the second option of engaging in the adventure modes.  This is the typical profitable app model that uses timer countdown limits (e.g. once you play one game, you must wait three hours until you can play again) that encourage the user to utilize in-app purchases to buy local currencies.  While I\u2019m not the biggest fan of this model, I understand that it\u2019s very prevalent and I\u2019ve become accustomed to being patient and looking forward to it.  What is the biggest disappointment is that many of the games are clearly fixed (in order to gain any significant advantage you would likely need to utilize further in-app purchases). I am obtaining my master\u2019s degree in statistics and the probability of some of these outcomes happening repeatedly and as constantly as they do is so remote that it has just become so discouraging.  If you\u2019re looking to play Yahtzee, don\u2019t get this app. The design is nice and the gameplay is superb, but unless you\u2019re looking for an app that you mindlessly check on every few hours or if you don\u2019t mind spending your actual money on this game, then go ahead and try it.  I had been really underwhelmed with the game that I had deleted it.  After having recently re-downloaded it, I will soon be deleting it again.</p>|I like the new version overall. Scorecards all on one screen, more new dice and frames and events and it seems fun!...Until you realize that they\u2019ve screwed you once again. Been playing for years now and I will not spend money for extra rolls, and if you don\u2019t, they make it more difficult to beat each stage in the showdown. They always have, so I\u2019m used to that. Sometimes it would take me a little longer to beat the whole thing and sometimes I\u2019d get close but couldn\u2019t beat it before the event was over. Fine. Well now, if you don\u2019t get extra rolls, you might as well forget it. I play frequently and have yet to make to beat one showdown. Honestly, they\u2019ve made it nearly impossible. Now, I do have to say that they have made it easier to win extra rolls on the scratchers. I\u2019d never won more than 3 before (again...been playing for years) and in the new version I\u2019ve already won 5 extra and 15 extra. But I guess because that improved, they had to do something to make other parts more difficult to entice you to buy more rolls. Needless to say, I was pretty excited at first but after a few weeks I\u2019ve become even more annoyed with it than I ever had been before. It\u2019s a bit ridiculous.  There are other minor things that would make it a little better, visually and whatnot, but I don\u2019t even care because I don\u2019t see myself playing as much anymore anyway. Quite disappointed.</p>|Several times with updates, the app crashes OFTEN during game play...or it\u2019ll crash when I\u2019m watching an ad &amp; then the free die or scratcher I\u2019m waiting for isn\u2019t rewarded. This doesn\u2019t make it tempting for a player to keep playing when one has to continually open the app to restart the game! The older version was much better; definitely in two ways. 1) The player could purchase &amp; choose the dice he/she wanted (with earned coins, not bought) instead of a \u201cclaw machine\u201d randomly picking the dice &amp; usually giving duplicates without the special effects! 2) The Showdown competitions posted the score the player needed to beat. At least this gave the player an idea of what the goal was that had to be reached. The current app version assures that a player, in most cases, will have to use extra dice to even attempt to beat the lineup of competitors in the Showdown. Doesn\u2019t make for much fun when you have a good score &amp; then the adversary\u2019s last roll is yet a third Yahtzee! Rigged? Totally! Sure, multiple Yahtzee\u2019s are possible. No doubt. But for most \u201creal\u201d players, it doesn\u2019t happen in such a regular basis as it does for the app characters. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I play several regular competitors &amp; for the time that I\u2019ve invested over the years, I would delete this app. I\u2019m glad for those who like the game, but it sure doesn\u2019t deserve a 4.4* in my experience.</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 72%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.4, 106.4K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#11 in Family"}, {"size": "101.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/amzn-mobile-llc/id297606954?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Amazon MusicWe\u2019re changing the way you find and play the music you love\u2022\tListen free with a Prime membership or get more with Amazon Music Unlimited\u2022\tGo hands-free with Alexa!

I know that the upcoming Tool music upload to my collection and this platform makes it easy.</p>|I really need to have a non-explicit screening and playlists to choose from. I listen to music with my kids in the car and we share so they can listen on their own without me hearing what they are listening to. The songs that I\u2019m hearing are so offensive that I am to the point where I can\u2019t use this at all and I\u2019m uninstalling from my kids phones. (I completely understand that they are picking these playlists so I\u2019m not nieve). Plus, I\u2019m telling people why I don\u2019t like it and many teen parent groups agree that this should not be used by young teens and even older teens but we can\u2019t be unrealistic. I am an advocate of keeping kids safe from unnecessary negative vulgar outside influences for as long as possible and this app does not keep kids safe at all.  If you had something in settings where I could select non-explicit only that would take care of it and I would prefer that. Plus, it should default to the \u2018safe\u2019 mode automatically when installed. The older kids will know where to go change it to explicit. The adults might have a problem though. If you fix this problem, my rating will change immediately. I have tried to find this feature so if you already have it, please let me know where it is. Mom of twin 13, 15, 25, and 29 year olds.</p>|I love the app, I\u2019ve had zero problems for the longest time. My only issue arose when J.I.D dropped Decaprio 2 recently. I downloaded the whole album, but then he changed the album cover, requiring me to redownload the album again. Usually when this happens it\u2019s no big deal, but for this album in particular when I go to play the new versions to the songs I previously downloaded, the app doesn\u2019t recognize those songs as new, and tries to play the old versions, which doesn\u2019t work. When I try to play those songs, the \u201cdownloaded music error\u201d message appears, giving me the options to either \u201cstart fresh\u201d or \u201credownload missing songs\u201d, neither of which amount to anything. I\u2019m unsure if this has happened to any other albums, but this is my first experience where the album is changed and the new versions cannot be played because the app only recognizes the old versions. Please fix this issue. Other than that, I have no complaints regarding the app. I love it, but I\u2019d love it more if I could listen to the explicit Decaprio 2- J.I.D album.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 84%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 219.7K Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#8 in Music"}, {"size": "58.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/hatsoffapps/id1111708684?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "* First Ever Celebrity Voice Changer * * Join Millions and Try it NOW *Celebrity Voice Changer lets you change your voice to any celebrity voice instantly, just by talking into a mic.

I thought that there was no possible way I could sound like a celebrity. Now, this technology is nowhere near perfect, but it does actually work. The trick is you need to be in a quiet room. I also noticed it works much better on newer iPhones than old ones. So make sure you have the latest operating system. It refers to some kind of old cartoon version on older operating systems. You also have to be the only one talking. When I tried using it with music in the background it sounded absolutely horrible. Like a robot being tortured. The next time I tried the application it worked perfectly, with no robotics sound. It\u2019s also important to note that the application can\u2019t get sounds, like laughing for example. Hopefully the developer can update this in a subsequent version? After I figured out how to use the app, I was able to create a bunch of hilarious videos. So basically, don\u2019t expect the world from this application, but also make sure use it properly and as intended. The technology is not quite good enough to work all of the time, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. I think the potential is there for this technology to become mainstream. Maybe even the voice of connected home devices, or my next car GPS\u2026 Only time will tell. In the meantime, developer, can you please add the voice of PewDiePie?</p>|When I downloaded this app, I was very excited as it seemed like the perfect app to have fun with friends with. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It has issues, at least for me, with picking up your voice when you speak into it. If this weren\u2019t already bad enough, when your voice has been changed, there are obvious, long pauses between each word making it very unrealistic and not worth your time, unless you are using it with children as many children would be thoroughly entertained by this app regardless of these pauses. Also, when you download the app, you must download a free trial and after this you must pay $9.99 each week to use it. Unfortunately for me, when you sign up for the free trial it subscribes you to it and will automatically charge you $9.99 each week, regardless of whether or not you still have the app downloaded on your phone, so if you delete the app, make sure to cancel the subscription in your settings! Luckily, Apple support was very helpful in getting me a refund on this as I did not realize I was subscribed. However, I do not appreciate that I was put through all this trouble. Overall, I feel that this app is very misleading and lackluster, but I am very happy that I was able to get a full refund on the charge for my subscription and I would recommend the app if you have children!</p>|Amazing app if you understand how to use it you can make the clips sound pretty freakin realistic.. talk in a moderate and clear voice and you can avoid the robo dialer sound. With this said having to wait a whole minute for 6 second clip isn\u2019t all that bad considering you can save the clip. I would like to see that if these are being post to public like show in that check box that you can see what other people have done, but you can really only save, share or replay. Now, yes. There is a 3 day trial which I am currently using which extends the clips to 15 seconds, but the app hopes to charge $10 dollars a week concluding that trial!? No thanks.. given the amount it crashes or can\u2019t understand a clip I record, the fact there aren\u2019t any additional features or voices that you can access from the subscription cost I\u2019m giving it a very generous rating. With that said the level of app uniqueness calls for such.. really it is worth a try, but the limited number of voices and it not having some sort of community access for the clips makes the VERY unsettling $40 dollars a month a major pass for me. All and all make what you will of them, but it is a pretty incredible piece of software and worth a try.</p>", "four_star": "width: 6%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 69%;", "one_star": "width: 17%;", "star": "4.1, 53.3K Ratings", "category": "Entertainment", "sub_rank": "#43 in Entertainment"}, {"size": "178.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/electronic-arts/id284800461?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Live your Star Wars\u2122 dreams as you fight with your favorite dark and light side heroes across iconic locations to become master of the galaxy.

Outstanding. All you need is a device that is up to date (I tried using a series 1 iPad mini and it kept crashing) and this game. The beginning of the game is slow and may be pretty boring (I just really wanted all the characters and at one point I only had three qualified characters for something) but as you get going your desire to play increases and things get good. I remember when I started playing I easily managed to get 5 light side characters ,however, things aren\u2019t as easy as they used to be for new players. An example would be when I started playing they had a free data card (this is not the bronzanuim card this is something different) that the first time you opened it you automatically got a free character ( this is also not the level 4 data card that you get in the tutorial) and after that you would get 4 shards for that character and his ship each time you opened said card (this was also a limited time thing around Christmas but last year they didn\u2019t have something like this for Last Jedi). Please download but please don\u2019t download if it\u2019s because of this review it would be better if you downloaded this app if you are interested and use this review as something to help encourage you to motivate others to approve or to get your friends playing. This is a great game for youtubers to make challenges to find who\u2019s better with a squad.</p>|Galactic war is a joke since update. The games set up now so you have to pay. Gold is too hard to come by and makes it hard to level up your characters. Fix the profit mining. What ea did to it is a joke as well.  I haven't wasted my time on it since first day of update. Going from 50 energy for 100,000 gold to 24 energy 8,400 gold with a 1 in a 100 shot of a 3x multiplier is just dumb. Why waste your time. Please fix this game. Was a five star game. Now it's only two and dropping.**********That was from a year ago and it's only been getting steadily worse. Getting rid of the booster pack will cost you more players. Only going to be whales left playing soon. You just can't compete with top teams. They release so many new and unnecessary toons now and the free to play people get farther and farther behind. If you're new to this game and aren't willing to drop thousands of dollars stay away. This isn't the game you're looking for. Hey I get it you want to cash in while you can. Just don't advertise yourself as free to play.*************The game get more and more glitchy the more they update it. Force closures happen at least twice a day. If you're lucky it's not during a arena fight. If you're not lucky it is and you lose that turn. Happening more and more especially in the ship arena. Galactic war balance is the worse it's been. They don't care and the brainwashed on the forums shut you down if you try to talk about it.

They are almost identical. I wish JPC had gold coins that you could trade for chips like Big Fish does. Yes, I agree that at times, it seems as if the winnings slow down but that\u2019s kind of to be expected. The more you spin, you rise in level. Every time you hit a new level, there are rewards. I don\u2019t have a lot of disposable income so I rarely buy chips. When I get low, I watch some ads, get free chips, bet low for a while, build up my chips, eventually level up, get more chips, bet a little higher, maybe win a jackpot or two, play it down and start the cycle over. I figure if I have enough chips to bet low I\u2019m still playing. It\u2019s not real money, people! Just because you lose it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re broke \u201cin real life\u201d. Wait a while, there will be free chips available and start playing again. I suggest joining a club. Unless you plan on buying a lot of chips and being super competitive I would join more of a social club. Try to fund at least every other day or so. I will admit all the \u201cthumbs up or liking\u201d gets annoying when I\u2019m trying to play. Sometimes I feel like chatting and sometimes my mind is in other places. All in all, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s a free download, you win, you lose and if you don\u2019t like it, no one is making you play. I give it 5 Thumbs up! I would have rated 5 stars but there\u2019s always room for improvements!</p>|Now all I get are zeros after zeros cannot reach one billion. Until the zeros stop the app is not used to play but for friendship I have been a family member of BF now for four years now and became a new member of jackpot city and have to say to all that jpc is very generous with there daily freebies and all the gifts they offer. I come on daily and each time there is another nice gift for free. The chips they offer is a lot. No one should complain about anything. The only thing I would like to share to BF is please turn my win button on for a while so I can play with my friends longer. Also that's another big thing that is great we can make friends from people all around the world. Last night the table I met five new friends each of us was from a complete different country. And all of us were in different time zones which we all laughed at how we all are addicted and have fallen asleep playing or staying up a whole day a night. That's why it's nice to build up our chips with wins so we can chat and play with great friends around the world. Ty BF keep up our freebies and intensives.</p>|Complete trash. I understand the need to pay bills with an app this big, but the amount of wins vs. losses is pathetic. If you\u2019re looking for a casino game to dink around in and not win anything (albeit fake chips) then you have found the game for you! If you are wanting something that you can enjoy playing, I\u2019ve found watching paint dry is WAY MORE ENTERTAINING. If you purchase fake chips with real money, you \u201cmight\u201d win. It\u2019s not completely guaranteed. The \u201ctournaments\u201d aren\u2019t random. The wins aren\u2019t random. If you aren\u2019t in the winning algorithm, you are simply just wasting your time away. The games themselves are fun, entertaining, inventive and the graphics are great. The concept that you can rank up and enjoy your \u201cfriends\u201d is a joke. People with multi hundred millions or billions typically ruin scatter pots, some people bully, most are creepers posting graphic pics on their profiles. More often than not, you are squatting in a scatter room waiting for other people to feed you chips because you don\u2019t want to spend your real money. I may be the exception but my kids needs are a tad more important than a corporations profits. At least make it attainable to have fun. Winning once every other month for a grand total of 40 minutes in a 24-hour period is absurd. Shame on you. Shame on your app. Shame on your programmers and shame on your ethics.</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 76%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.6, 154.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#28 in Casino"}, {"size": "338.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 10%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/storm8-studios/id967465771?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Welcome to Home Design Makeover!

I have made it to level 1289, and yes the challenges get harder and harder. I have also downloaded the other Home Design game. It doesn\u2019t have the ticket challenges. A lot of the games I have played on the regular game comes up in the home maker over game. I do not buy diamonds I just wait till my new lives have refilled. What I am concerned about is the ticket games has such high score needed like needing 50 or above tickets or the coin values in non ticket games. And some of the non hard games are actually harder than some of the hard games. Sometimes I will be doing a ticket game and need a few tickets to complete the decorating scene and the the ticket game disappears when the time is up. I think that is where I get frustrated the most. Then I say it\u2019s only a game. What reward do we get any way after working so hard. There should be rewards for hard games completed or if we reach 1000 or more points or more. I think too we should be given an option to continue on ticket games for a certain amount of coins. At first when I first started playing, the little monsters that ate our pieces or multiplied those were hard games, now they have the flowers that kind of does the same things, they eat our pieces. I would like to see it more interesting, not harder just more interesting. Sincerely Dee.</p>|I have been playing this game for several months now and, like other reviewers, I\u2019m tired of getting stuck on the same level for days. I\u2019m also getting quickly annoyed with the \u201ccandy crush\u201d concept of the game. If levels are going to be that difficult and that central to the gameplay, then we should receive at least 10 energy a day and a higher monetary reward for the more difficult it is to beat. We\u2019re all here for an interest in home design, not to be stuck trying to beat a \u201ccandy crush\u201d level for three days; not to mention that after it\u2019s all said and done, we only receive enough coins to purchase one feature for the house... I just would really love to spend more of my time designing than trying to beat a match level. Also, I LOVE(d) the limited challenge concept. I beat the first challenge in a day and I was so excited to start the next one, however, my amusement ended quickly when there was no reward whatsoever given for completing the challenge and the next challenge has not presented itself yet... I mean come on guys, really? Gaining coins is difficult enough already, and as I said before, I want to spend more time in the design concept, not the matching puzzle game. So keep the challenges rolling in and try to find a balance between the match game and the design portion. All in all, the graphics are beautiful and the design elements are awesome but the game needs to be more playable and engaging if it wishes to be more successful.</p>|For those of you who want to download a good game- pls read this!! This game is very boring. I downloaded it thinking that you could actually design your own dream home, but it turns out that you actually have to design only one room for some specific person (u don't get to choose the room), and plus you have to use your coins to pay for the furniture, which nobody wants to do. And you can't just earn coins either. You have to play this matching game to win them (another thing: the levels get really REALLY hard after level 20, so that's just another warning) and who wants 2 do that when this is a designing app??!! Designing has nothing to do with a matching game!!! It's basically more matching than desgiegning. And they only give you three options for a furniture choice, which is very limited. Basically I'm saying that you're not actually the one who picks the room you design and the furniture, they're the ones that do, and that's no fun. And then it's annoying because if you don't want 2 earn coins by playing that really tricky matching game, you have to buy them for like $5, which nobody wants to even consider. When you just pretty much waste your coins buying the furniture for the rooms you don't even get to pick. I literally got bored 30 minutes after playing this. So two days after I deleted it. Was very disappointed. I definitely wouldn't recommend this 4 people who are easily bored.</p>", "four_star": "width: 15%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 59%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.1, 18.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#29 in Simulation"}, {"size": "678 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/foxnext-games-llc/id1292952048?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "In MARVEL Strike Force, ready for battle alongside allies and arch-rivals in this action-packed, visually-stunning free-to-play game for your iPhone or iPad.

First off, amazing game, gorgeous graphics, literally my favorite game and I love how everything was put together. Alright... let\u2019s talk about Iron Fist. I was a fan of the Netflix show The Iron Fist and the Defenders. What I saw was that through the episodes, the iron fist\u2019s power was growing to the point where he not only had the ability to hit one person, but he also could also affect several. For example, if he hits the ground with the Fist, everyone around him is affected and gets injured. Of course, you already know where I\u2019m heading with this. In Marvel Strike Force, it would be sooo nice to see Iron Fist have that AOE. The animations could be him getting in the center, jumping, and hitting the ground hard with his Fist and affect the opposing team. Obviously if this feature is added, one of the current abilities would have to go. Here\u2019s what I think. First attack should stay the same, special attack should be the iron fist to a single target, the ultimate would be the aoe where he hits the ground and does damage to the whole enemy team, and the passive would be the healing. So yes, the current special ability (the healing) would be gone. It\u2019s current passive ability already has healing so having something different yet amazing would nice to see! Thank you so much for you time!! Hope you can consider it!</p>|First of all, this game is not pay to win, I have reached level 55 after only 2 - 3 weeks of playing. To be honest, the grind is not nearly as bad as Galaxy of Heroes, and you can take my word on that, I am level 80 in GoH. Due to the fact that this game did not implement a unsatisfying and long grind like most games on the App Store, I already love this game. Second of all, for the most part it is not a hassle to earn shards for the characters you want. For example, if you go for a certain character, chances are you will get him or her in no time due to the varying amount of ways you can earn said shards for said character. If I had any complaints, it would be that the minion characters like the Hydra Scientist are not as powerful as actual heroes and villains. Could you maybe make it where they have an extra ability / trait or maybe more ability levels on the abilities they already have? I would like the minion characters and regular characters to be on the same level if possible. Also, an idea I had for the game was a ability fragment refund system, it would allow you to refund ability fragments for characters you do not usually use anymore for upgrading characters you use now. I understand if you do not implement this, just a suggestion on my part. Thanks for reading, From a Strike Force Player</p>|The greatest thing about this game is that there is no \u201cpay to win\u201d wall you have to get around, yet. With time and patience a completely free to play player could rise to the top. My only issue, is with the recent character additions that could change the meta. They hinder the free to play player too much. Obviously a pay to play AKA a whale will be able to buy orbs and get their 7 star character. But giving free to play players a slim chance to even unlock this new character doesn\u2019t seem like a strong business plan. Even the dolphins struggle and want to spend less and less. If they would let us get a 4 star with constant free to play schedule behavior and then offer the offers to get that character to 5 stars, that would be the winning formula. It would let free to play win, dolphins win and pay to plays win. Everyone would be happy. Unfortunately, it\u2019s leading towards the SWGOH way where if you don\u2019t have the pay to play character, and the free to plays don\u2019t get that character, you\u2019re stuck. AKA the JTR wall. Otherwise, I would rate this game a 5/5 I spend more time \u201cbabying\u201d this game than I do swgoh. I love how each and every character can be viable. I love the formats of combat and competition. If they got their new character release avenues correct, this game would be 6/5</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 79%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.6, 94.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#32 in Role Playing"}, {"size": "141.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/visual-supply-company/id513526768?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "VSCO is a place to express your true self, make beautiful photos on mobile, and connect with a creative community.

A few minutes ago I offloaded the app and I had to delete it for storage purposes and I\u2019ve offloaded it many times before. THAT WAS MY BIGGEST MISTAKE. All the pictures, everything from the last few years was GONE. I opened the app and clicked to make sure everything was still there and it was all gone. Only the things I posted were still there. All the Instagram photos I edit are all on vsco, every picture that needs some changes was on vsco, and now everything was just gone. More than two years of my life in photos was on there and I downloaded it again and it was. All. Gone. I definitely cried for a good 30 minutes and I\u2019m still so so so upset. I don\u2019t understand why the app can\u2019t save the photos it\u2019s completely gone and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I\u2019m still going to use it but for future reference I guess I have to private upload them in order for it to save. I have suffered a great loss, and I hope someone sees this before they make the same mistake I do.</p>|I use this to edit all my photos and I love it, I'm also a VSCO X member and I definitely recommend it for everyone. But, I would like it if you guys made the highlight option to not only take away highlights but to enhance them as well, or present an option where I can select what portions of my image I want highlighted (I\u2019d prefer this more), and the same for shadows. Also, I\u2019d like to be able to add presets to DSCO, not just the ones you offer as soon as I take it, because the way it functions now I\u2019d have to save the DSCO, then re upload it to VSCO, which I find tedious. I\u2019d also like the option to turn other videos I have into DSCO. Oh, also for DSCO, I want to be able to save it to my VSCO library, instead of only being to save it to my phone or uploading it to my VSCO feed, and make it longer, DSCOs are so short. And it would be cool if you introduced options that are fun like chromatic aberration, or vintage scratches and dust. If you guys had all these things I wouldn\u2019t touch another app lol.

I lost about 30 pounds before my transplant because I knew it would be a hard transition and it is important to give yourself and those helping you the best edge you possibly can. It\u2019s also important to really educate yourself on nutrition and your body, I studied nutrition on my own did all the exercises I could, learned my body type and how I metabolize food. I also consult with my doctors and get blood work done so I know how to best tweak my diet to maximize my diet and health. Get some it\u2019s always wise to consult with your doctors and even get a basic basic metabolic panel done to check your blood work. I recently gained a few pounds back from being on high doses of prednisone and others that made me super hangry like that already food loving person I am. As knowledgeable I am about nutrition I\u2019m not a machine and this app keeps me accountable and allows me to make the most of my health habits. The key is to have a healthy balance and not obsess over losing weight and constantly over analyzing everything. It also helps me remember to hydrate. Don\u2019t go crazy extreme, pace yourself and allow yourself to have many of the things you crave don\u2019t over indulge make healthier versions of what you crave and eat smaller portions of the things you really want.</p>|In my own, personal opinion, the features that would earn fifth star would be to expand compatibility toward Polar brand products and applications, and to allow users to enter in specific ingredient, calorie, macro/micronutrient restrictions to be alerted to in meals &amp; recipes.  It would be great to know if something I ate (or am logging because I'm about to eat) will conflict with a low FODMAP diet, or has more of a specific nutrient than I want at the time.  I recall a previous version that would offer food tips (\"this food is high in sodium\", \"this food is a great source of vitamin c\", etc.)I haven't yet tried the paid version, and these could be included there, but I felt it worth mentioning.  Overall, the app comes packed with so many intuitive, convenient features, I have succeeded in making journaling with it part of my daily dietary considerations.  The terms and conditions of the challenges offered are abjectly terrifying, though, and ought to be more prominently featured before agreeing to them.  Currently, the language you provide allows sponsoring companies the freedom to scour my phone for any notes I've taken to work on business projects of my own during my participation, and hamstrings me to do anything to defend my own privacy and trade secrets afterward if they take any action on them.  Not cool.</p>|I used to love this app and many of its features but I find it lacking after having my baby. Not only does the weight gain from my pregnancy look negative on the chart (well duh I made a child), but there are many of the features that make it seem like I\u2019m lazy or not putting in the effort to stay healthy. The calorie intake is much less than what I should be eating because I\u2019m breastfeeding but it turns negative when I include the snacks because it goes over the calorie goal. Not to mention that exercise is limited postpartum. I\u2019m not asking for my fitness pal to keep track of my breastfeeding or anything like that (there are many other apps for that) but it would be nice if there was a note you could add or status change that one could add that encourages mamas who are recovering from labor. Not put us down for not being able to keep up with our diets and exercise habits pre-child. A little encouragement, especially around the 5th and 6th week postpartum would be beneficial since that is around the time when most moms can actually begin to work out and do light exercises. This app is really helpful because it helps me make sure I\u2019m eating enough, especially since it\u2019s hard to stay sane with a newborn and lack of sleep. I just wish it was more mama friendly because many fitness apps seem to completely forget that labor and recovery ain\u2019t easy. \ud83d\ude25</p>", "four_star": "width: 15%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 80%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 493.1K Ratings", "category": "Health & Fitness", "sub_rank": "#4 in Health & Fitness"}, {"size": "204.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/playtika-santa-monica-llc/id504720043?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Welcome to Bingo Blitz, the #1 free bingo game online!Take a trip around the Bingo World with your Bingo host - Blitzy!

BB, for a couple of years now.  It's true the game has changed from when I first started and was more fun and competitive then than it is now.  But one thing this app has that others don't is you can help your fellow BB players is they need an item.  I've not come across another app that does that. It def fosters interaction between users.  Yes, this app has MANY shortcomings that have been implemented since I first became a member,  They have been told by thousands of users to please make changes but the it seems the developers do not care to listen to the customers.  They should remove making cards 1 &amp; 2 \"free\".  They should stop telling customers that it is a game of \"chance\" because we constantly get shadow cards 1-5 in play FAR MORE OFTEN than any of the \"hard-to-gets\" or \"very-hard-to-gets\"...please stop insulting our intelligence.  I continue to play this app because it takes me back to the days when I played Bingo with my Grandmother then my Father.  This app lets you help your fellow members if you \"happen\" to be fortunate enough to get a spare shadow card that they need.  I recommend you play BB and form your own opinion.  I recommend to BB to listen to their customers and remove all your restrictions, etc.  BB can really be a fun game to play.</p>|I have been playing for over 6 years.  I looked forward to daily credits and finishing the rooms. It has been my favorite game! With the new changes recently its more difficult to get bingos, complete rooms and win credits. I can't afford to purchase credits and boosters, however; Yesterday I was trying to complete a room, Central Park that was closing and I needed just one item.  An easy item, Alice in Wonderland Statue!  I had 2 hours....I ended up buying credits 4 times using about 500 credits but unfortunately I never completed the room. I noticed in the chat area several people were wanting everyone playing in that room not to hit a bingo so the one that needed it could get the bingo. They were rude, distracting and it was confusing to me. In this room I had multiples of every other item, HTG and VHTGs I had more than one, some I had 4-5. I had never been as upset and disappointed playing my Bingo Blitz as I was last night. This is a game I love playing but after this experience I am unsure if I will continue.  I feel like I lost 1325 credits made me sad.  Otherwise I would have given a 5 Star.  I tried to find on the app where I could file a complaint, unable to find. Thank You for listening. I will never know if I've been heard.</p>|I have been a huge Blitz fan since 2012, but Bingo Blitz is not the game it used to be.  Blitz did an update today, no problem.  Except when a player and I traded buddies, two things happened- we both lost the spare from our inventory and we did NOT receive the gifted buddy.  I tried to log off and nothing.  I went to support to contact them and all I get is this message to clear history and cookies, which I do daily so that is not the problem.  I tried every way to contact them to report the issue and you cannot get where the submit a ticket is.  I have to one, apologize for overreacting last night and for the poor taste of post. I have since deleted that completely.  Luckily the person I have traded with did receive the Buddy I sent to her this morning.  However, I have not received #44 as of yet.  I know that she sent it, as we have been game friends for years, and it is missing from her inventory.  So Blitzy if you could locate the missing Buddy I would appreciate it.   I do think that to submit a ticket or complaint should be easier, and hope you will consider changing your program to contact you.  So for this I am lowering my 5 star rating to a 4 star.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 58.2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#12 in Casino"}, {"size": "631.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/rovio-entertainment-oyj/id298910979?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Play the world's best bird flinging, pig popping game!Use the slingshot to fling birds at the piggies' towers and bring them crashing down \u2013 all to save the precious eggs.New to the world of Angry Birds?

But instead it is geared to the mega coiners who are addicted to win no matter the cost. Game starts out really fun and funny and I thought oh wow this is awesome, but the higher level you progress in the game the harder and more frustrating it becomes to complete levels. And of course the game gives you that chance to level up by spending gems which you can win some in game but just enough to tease and hook you that you got to spend real cash to buy more. Games like this that kids would love should be banned from children of any age because all it does is feed their impulsive addictive behavior and will drive their parents nuts asking for or getting more and more money to play this. Really sad the way all these gaming companies have gone. Instead of paying a set price for a complete game they choose to entice people along in many different ways in their games to spend FOREVER on their games. GREED pure and simple and I for one am sick of it.  Are you kidding me! Either by design or glitch I am not credited with apples I earn and apples also disappear! I log off with 12 apples next day I log in I have 10 apples! You have to have apples to feed little Boomer every 24 hours. Unbelievable you even do not let the players get enough apples to feed Boomer in hopes that the players spend cash. This is truly sick to pull fast ones like this on children who would be playing this game.</p>|I think this game is perfectly fine, a previous review stated that kids have to pay to play and that\u2019s a problem today, well I disagree. I\u2019ve been playing for a year now and have not spent a dime.. parents should be teaching patience, discipline, and waiting for good things to come... not \u201c Immediate gratifications\u201d we always feed our kids with money and happiness to keep them satisfied. But then when they finally grow up, they run into so much disappointment that they can\u2019t handle it.. these games are able to be played at a slow and steady pace with the ability to advance with out the need to spend spend spend, if you have patience.. I play a few min everyday and I continue to progress.. I don\u2019t need to run ramped and make it to the end and try to win the game all in 1 day or even a week...it\u2019s meant to provide long lasting steady enjoyment, not consume your whole life.. I say take a moment and show a child how to play and then put it down and wait for another day to play again!

I have learned that this game is once you get into the higher levels impossible to win without spending about 15,000 tokens. So either get ready to spend a lot of money or just let it turn off going to be able to before you play and I mean a ton.  And when you notice that it's taking me a coin set a given them to you in the game is very bad about it then expect them to give them back to you because I have sent emails to you in the last week and a half and have yet to get a response even though it says you need a 48 to 72 hours downtime I don't what clock they use but my 72 hours was over four days ago . So I emailed them day  before yesterday asking them how long is your 72 hours and they have not responded so I guess I won't be getting those took back but I've noticed a lot that when I exit exam my tokens will go down tremendously and this is after I have won that round . This game definitely issues had a couple of updates at least one that I know of and I'm not sure if that's when all this started you're not I just know that I'm through with the ignoring the emails and stealing my tokens . don't waste your money on this game or your time! If I don't hear back by Monday I'm deleting this game I can't afford it.</p>|This game is fun, but very costly.  Not only in game play requiring purchases of booster cards and +5 more cards to finish a level, but also in how many times each day it crashes after you pay all that and then it crashes usually right at the end right before you're about to win.  You just spent all those coins and lost them.  And it usually happens for me once every tribute round, so you lose the tributes too.  And if you write to the developers, if they respond and reimburse you, it's not anywhere close to what you lost.  I have gone into detail of exactly how much I spent and lost on a crash and the reimbursement was about a tenth.  Multiply that loss by the 4-5 times I play each day on average.  And if I play for a long stretch of time an hour or so, it crashes at least 3 times in that hour while I'm playing.  Oh, and then there's my favorite, when you play, win, the game says there's been an unexplained error and to try again later, so it doesn't pay out the coins, tributes, or stars it owes you, and then repeated does it over and over again, but somehow manages to take your money when you enter to play and purchase boosters and extras.  So you can take my coins, but \"error\" on the payout.  Repeatedly.  Daily basis.  If these things are corrected, I'll be back to upgrade my rating.  If not, I'll decrease my rating.</p>|This game is fun to play. But you don\u2019t get the same amount of free coins as others do. It has nothing to do with the level your on or how much you play. Once a day you get ads that give you coins. These coins are vital to the game. Without them you\u2019re game time is very limited. It cost a lot per game and you can\u2019t make it through many levels without using boosters, which cost 6k in coins per booster. Some levels you need as many as 3 boosters per play. That\u2019s 18k plus what it cost to play the level which is usually 2-3k each. Which brings most levels up to 21k per level. The problem is a lot of people get 25-30 ads daily for coins then the rest get 10 ads per day for coins. Ads pay between 300 to 5000 each. So you can see where you are being cheated real easy. I\u2019ve complained at least 5 or more times about making the ads equal so every one gets a decent chance. They have refused to help me with this. They claim they have no control over ads. No one has a site that they have no control over. I know a ton of people that have complained about this as well. We as players just want the freebies to be fair to all of us that spend our time playing there game. Bottom line they DONT CARE. It\u2019s a shame to because this game is fun it\u2019s just not fair. I assure you that if you encounter a problem it will not be fixed.</p>", "four_star": "width: 16%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 76%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 39.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#17 in Card"}, {"size": "113.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 7%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/huuuge-games-sp-z-o-o/id314395447?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The Billionaire welcomes you to his Casino with the best slots!

You meet great people and can chat with them, but unfortunately you lose friends when you lose chips. You have to keep purchasing chips over and over, and they aren\u2019t cheap! As far as winning goes, you have to be super lucky to win anything that will last you awhile. I\u2019ve only won slightly big twice in half a year, and immediately the chips vanished. As far as the people I\u2019ve talked to, this is the same for them. The only thing descent is the chips you collect from club events, or a particular slot that is to be played until a certain amount of points are reached, then a very small payout is given to all club members. They do have a few enticing events such as lotto which has a bigger payout on Saturdays and sometimes another day during the week, but don\u2019t expect to get the big prize unless you\u2019re willing to fork out $100. Sometimes after paying $20 you can barely make $700 million which only lasts if you bet very low. I\u2019m very close to leaving this game altogether as I have converted my friends to Facebook, and can talk to them there, but we try and play everyday because of the club. I just wish this game paid out a little more, like there machines weren\u2019t so tight, and they lowered the price on chips. We\u2019re not rich here. If we were we\u2019d be playing in a real casino.</p>|I\u2019ve been playing for awhile now . Spent a lot of money but it seems that just when you think you have enough chips the games just eat it up. The losing percentage compared to the winning is 10/1 also buying lottery tickets are fun but incentives are continuously being cut . You are down to 70 million for bronze. You took awayThe ability to buy yourself chips and give to friends with the use of diamonds. Your daily spins are quite hilarious you can\u2019t play for 5 minutes with usually getting 560,000., and that\u2019s playing modestly. Yes I do understand it is my choice to spend money on this game. But geeeeze give your players more incentives not take them away. Even when using the lotto tickets we don\u2019t earn silver that also got reduced to bronze. The explanation of oh but cutting it down to 7 instead of 10 is irrelevant. You still accumulate less chips. I have read a lot of reviews and see I\u2019m not the only unhappy player . And based on that i won\u2019t be surprised if you are the type of people that stay in business just long enough to make millions and disappear. So yes just like a scam. I also have been over charged and if I remember correctly did not receive what I bought. So my review for this game is a negative 10. In closing your support team doesn\u2019t answer questions or resolve the players issues. Just the same answer.\u201dwe will pass this on to who knows who\u201d and think they\u2019re helping . \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4eDissatisfied player,Jody</p>|I had a similar issue with the billionaire casino games.  I spent a very large some of money to by puzzle pieces since the gold during promos wins 7 billion dollars well this special offer was 10 billion so I Definitely wanted to buy some puzzle pieces.  Well when I spent all that money I complained to customer service saying it used to be much easier and spent less money to win puzzles.  Well not only did I get some great explanations but as a courtesy management gave me 1 billion dollars and the cool thing is I played one more time and purchased one more set of gold tickets and won the 10 billion too which gave me 16 billion total.  So thanks for the great encouragement and the bonus money.  And also I\u2019ve been winning a slot more slots lately so I still have same amount of money.  Another tip the more you play these games the better you get at it and you learn how to win them by shear experience.  So thank you management.  A little luck helps too.  So keep on playing and you will learn to win.  I love billionaire game out of all the slot apps I have.  Also support is excellent they will really encourage you and don\u2019t complain to just maybe get bonus money.  They can\u2019t do that for everybody.  But beKind when you complain and make sure it is legitimate and relevant. They are good folks!!</p>", "four_star": "width: 19%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 64%;", "one_star": "width: 7%;", "star": "4.3, 15.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#32 in Casino"}, {"size": "181.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 7%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/doubleugames-co-ltd/id642727746?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Enjoy the ultimate casino experience!

Hit a few \u2018true\u2019 jackpots in my first 5 months.....but nothing since November and I play pretty regularly.   I have over $60M in \u2018my pot\u2019, so understand some of the frustrations some have voiced, but also understand it\u2019s the luck of the slot you get.  I have noted that at the beginner level some of the slots with really high jackpots have people who hog the machines for days on end.   (One on Halloween Heroes has been on the same slot for over a week!).  Cannot imagine they are playing that entire time... just keeping it \u2018open\u2019 on their system so they can go back to it when they want to play and hope to win that big payout.  I think they need to set it up so that after an hour of inactivity you are automatically disconnected to give everyone a fair shot at those slots when they are not playing.UPDATE TO RESPONSE:  I understand it is the luck of the draw and commented as much in my review above.  Your \u2018canned\u2019 response (same as on some other reviews) did not address my concern about people hogging high jackpot machines at the beginner level for weeks on end.  I cannot imagine they are playing non-stop 24/7.  After an hour or two of inactivity playing on a machine you should disconnect them so others have opportunities to play those slots.</p>|What I'm going to say next is true of every casino worldwide.Have you ever noticed that sometimes you can win bigtime and later that afternoon was awful because you lost all of your money.....Well almost. My advise is to stop playing when there is a blatant lack of wining no matter what you do and if I buy more chips that makes matter worse because I for sure win nothing, nothing, nada. There are certain times of the day/ night your luck will change. Keep playing and you should win depending on what and how you bet. But when you play and suddenly realize that you've won nothing in twenty minutes, unlike the same twenty minutes in the early morning when you won more than ever, quit, log out, whatever it takes to see you are likely not to win so wait a few hours and try playing from 5 pm on. I call that Happy Hour in slotsville. Another time to play is 1 am and if you aren't winning either of those two time suggestions do your own comparisons, your own statistics, you'll learn when to stop playing even if takes several losing streaks.Thanks. Don\u2019t mind me. Should take my own advice and keep playing only if I\u2019m winning. I love this app.</p>|Game is beautifully designed, but winning is another story. There are ample opportunities to score dollars through bonus spins, league play, and the mystery box.. however, after playing this game for literally months and months on end, I have not once hit a natural jackpot on any of the machines in this game (and I have played on most every machine at one point or the other). It\u2019s a bit frustrating to play over and over and never really come close to a natural jackpot.  I understand the concept of luck but, like real casino machines, some could stand to be \u201clooser\u201d.   I find myself retreating to other games recently simply because my efforts have proven largely fruitless.  And I also agree that access to Mega and Grand machines is extremely difficult. Not sure how this can be remedied, but having access to only 10 or so machines at a time limits play, especially on newer machines.There seems to be a reasonable number of people winning jackpots (apparently with smaller bets as well).  Just hasn\u2019t happened for me after soooooooo much play... I\u2019m ready to move on to something else.UPDATE: Received same canned response from developer as pretty much everyone else here who has left a review. If you can\u2019t take the time to write a short, personalized response, then I won\u2019t waste time and money on your product.

Can\u2019t figure out the scoring. Some reviews criticize the  \u201cbonus\u201d word because it\u2019s mandatory that you find it before moving on. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bonus word, per se. Finding that word does \u201cpay\u201d out in \u201cgame coins\u201d that allow you to buy hints.  That\u2019s their only purpose or use, as far as I can tell. And, yes, you do have to find it before moving on. The whole game could use some clearly written -out COMPLETE instructions and information on scoring, in case that affects someone\u2019s methods of word guessing. The only thing remotely like directions is masked as the first several stupid-easy \u201clevels\u201d when a pop-up indicates how to run your finger along the letters to make the words, and that for help you can touch two icons: one to mix-up the letters and one to get hints. It doesn\u2019t mention that the hints \u201ccost\u201d those \u201cgame coins\u201d mentioned earlier.  I think putting in wrong guesses may adversely affect the score. Don\u2019t really know. Sometimes a correct word is worth 1 point and sometimes it seems to be worth 2. No explanation on scores. But that\u2019s okay with me. I don\u2019t pay attention to the score. By the way, I accidentally bumped one of the \u201cbuy this offers\u201d and my screen went black. It wouldn\u2019t go on or go back (I waited quite a while). I even left the game and reopened but it still went to a black screen. I had to remove the app and re install it, but it started over with the first level. :-(</p>|I absolutely love this game!! It has so many unique additions to it that other word games don\u2019t have\u2014 the daily gift, the combo quests (which always make finding words even more fun!), the beautiful backgrounds and the \u201cpath\u201d you take to get to the next level, and the daily awakening feature (basically the daily puzzle- and, like other games, if you find a certain amount of words in the right order, you get between 1-3 stars; those stars add up, but once you reach a certain amount, you can collect a \u201cmind stone\u201d) and I get so excited when I know I\u2019m about to collect a mind stone!! They\u2019re unique, associated with an animal, and give you a little inspirational saying, and you never know what they\u2019re going to say so it feels like a surprise. I just love them. So the only thing I would ask- because I love these mind stones so much- is if maybe y\u2019all could please add more? I\u2019m 2 mind stones away from having all of them, but I would love it if there were more added in the next update since right now there are just 16. Although it does take some time to reach 16, as the max number of stars you can receive per day is 3, I\u2019ve been playing for a while now and would love to keep collecting more!</p>|Game started getting stuck loading at 1% then freezes and crashes. Can't even open it half the time... Repetitive words, made up words, ads after every single level...made the mistake of paying to remove them because at first the game is really fun and addictive. But once you get to higher levels and like ten in a row have the same words repeated just kinda makes it annoying after a while. Anyways there is a lot of potential to be a good game it just needs some fine tuning. The reward system needs work as well. It is very confusing right now, what are the flowers for? The gold rewards seem kind of skimpy as well. Also you lose your bonus streak even if you enter in a legit word and sometimes that legit word gets you the bonus.....I can understand losing your bonus for entering in something that is just gobbledegook but why not extra points for real words? Annnnnd then you can go to the next level and enter in that SAME word from that last puzzle and it accepts it?! So convoluted. Also after the game stopped opening I uninstalled it and reinstalled it to see if that would resolve the issue. I was also logged into Facebook at the time might I add. When I reinstalled the game and logged back in I had lost all my progress....what's the point of logging in when all it does is show me what my friends scores are. Also there doesn't seem to be game center support either...

So I try to use this app (connected via Bluetooth to my car stereo). The first time I launch it in my car, it works great. It streams my station the whole way. So then I get to where ever I\u2019m driving to and leave my car, taking my phone with me. When I get back to my car (5 minuets or 5 hours later - it doesn\u2019t matter), I expect it to continue streaming (the same station as before - like when I use the Apple Music app, for example). The app doesn\u2019t stream any more. So I launch the app and I can navigate the interface, but it won\u2019t stream the station I was playing before, it won\u2019t stream anything. I have to force quit the app and relaunch it to get it to work again. This happens every time I turn off my car and then comeback later. I totally understand that network errors happen with internet streams and cell networks, but given that this is a mobile app that is based on network connectivity-I would expect it to handle errors more gracefully and recover (without a force quit). This has been an issue with the app for more than a year-every couple updates they release, I try the latest version again and every time I get this same problem. Does anyone know a better app for this?</p>|So I heard good things about this app so I downloaded it. You have the option of a 7day free trial or a 30day free trial. I selected the 30 day and started my membership. So I searched through the stations for the radio stations I listen to so I can listen to them while I travel and the 3 stations I listen to in my hometown are not even available on the app. So the whole purpose of getting this app was to be able to listen to those stations. Since I couldn\u2019t I decided to cancel my free trial and call it a day but you can\u2019t cancel from the app. It tells you to cancel from the iTunes Store. So when you go to the iTunes Store on your phone you can\u2019t cancel it from your phone you have to get on the computer. They make it very difficult for people to cancel their membership especially if the app doesn\u2019t even offer the stations I was looking for. It would have been great if it offered those stations and I would have kept the membership but it doesn\u2019t and the process to cancel is too much you should be able to cancel from the app. I don\u2019t back my phone up to a computer I use the iCloud so this just created unnecessary work for someone who doesn\u2019t have a personal computer. If I could give this app 0 stars I would.</p>|I just downloaded Tunein radio. You have to be careful and read everything before you tap GET. I noticed that I was taken fo a screen that gave you a choice between 7 days or 30 days for free trial for Tunein Premium but does not disclose amount which is not good business honesty to display in my opinion. I was confused and just clicked on the X to the left and got out. However I went back and read all of Tunein radio description and it DOES tell you the difference between the plain Tunein vs the premium But you need to read carefully. When I don\u2019t understand where I am I look for that X. Anyway I checked to see if I was charged and I wasn\u2019t so I did the right thing. Tunein Radio is free. The radio station I was looking for endorsed Tuneinradio to find their station.  I will give it sometime and then probably will change it to a 4 Star because I just got it today. So far I am pleased because I have the radio station I wanted.\ud83d\ude0a</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 83%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 330.3K Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#27 in Music"}, {"size": "27.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/betternet-llc/id453214294?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "With Betternet VPN Proxy your data will be encrypted and your online activities will remain private and secure.

It works ok (sometimes not working) for less than three weeks. And then not able to connecting at all. Every time it said \u201csomething went wrong\u201d or just connecting for a while then gave up (appeared like I never clicked the connect), or some other words but no be able to connect. So I tried to contact the support team but it insisted asked me to set up a \u201cmail account\u201d??? I have my email address registered already. What does that supposed to mean? So I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Funny thing is that it won\u2019t allow me to \u201cinstall profile\u201d in setting. When I clicked \u201cinstall profile\u201d, it jumped to the VPN setting page and no matter what I chose, the app stayed the same, at the \u201cinstall profile\u201d page. After more than fifty times of this repeating process, I gave up. I was not be able to contact the support team nor be able to connect or set up the VPN configuration. Worst part is I\u2019m paying for this \u201cnot working\u201d service. I tried a free VPN. It works just fine. Not sure why I purchased this app in first place. 1 star is a compliment to its function. It should earn no star at all.</p>|Okay so the only reason I use this app is because our school\u2019s WiFi blocked basically every social media app that TEENS USE EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES. Here\u2019s the deal. Sometimes whenever I open Snapchat the Betternet app just randomly disconnects and then every time I try to send my streaks or even so much as one snap, the VPN app tears up my service and my streaks take decades to send. Sometimes I even have to turn off both the app and the WiFi in order for my snaps to be able to send more quickly. Yeah that doesn\u2019t help either, because sometimes the app reconnects itself even when I\u2019m using data and just makes the service even worse. I\u2019ve also tried deleting and reinstalling the app several times, and it only works on occasion or when I\u2019m on any other WiFi other than the school\u2019s WiFi.The general gravity of this situation is that this app just ruins my service and I hate it. Every time I\u2019m somewhere where Snapchat is blocked on their WiFi, BETTERNET WORSENS THE SERVICE! IT\u2019S SUPPOSED TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE NOT DETERIORATE IT! It\u2019s called BETTERnet for a reason! This app needs a lot of adjustments.</p>|Presumptively believing your promotion for authentic and secure protection from online visibility along with concealment of identity and such information, I\u2019ve taken the risk and installed this app only to realize THE FIRST thing your service requires is VPN configuration, which is necessary nevertheless, however to allow installment and operation there\u2019s a clear warning stating that if I did indeed want to allow VPN configuration than I must allow the tracking and monitoring of my information. Am I missing something here or is that the most contradictory statement I\u2019ve ever encountered. I mean anonymity should be profound and respected, not warranting and agreeing to collect my data when I\u2019m using the app. Even IF any information pertaining my security and identity is being withheld with collective use of your app, why is it necessary for you to collect it. Certainly If someone needed such information, wouldn\u2019t it be ideal and simple to just obtain it from your database? This app is complete joke and I still can\u2019t seem to understand it\u2019s implications regarding anonymity</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 79%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.5, 122.8K Ratings", "category": "Productivity", "sub_rank": "#5 in Productivity"}, {"size": "170.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/nintendo-co-ltd/id1062496488?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Nintendo's hit strategy-RPG Fire Emblem series, which has been going strong for more than 25 years, continues its journey on smart devices.Fight battles customized for touch screens and on-the-go play.

While this app doesn\u2019t have that, there is an element of chance in getting heroes you want. While I generally keep low expectations, I constantly am pleasantly surprised when I see those five stars fall into place across my screen.Regarding the gameplay, I certainly enjoy fire emblem more, but the customizability of the characters\u2019 skills and the ability to make any character a solid threat through enough investment make the game fun. While events and new story are the main fun of the game, I still occasionally enjoy training up my units and seeing them completely destroy the enemy arena/hero battle team, but if IS stopped doing events I\u2019d probably lose interest a lot faster than in the main games.I genuinely think this game is more fun the more Fire Emblem games you play, so if you are reading this and you\u2019ve only played one or two fire emblem games, give this a shot and then try some of the other games if you find characters are too unfamiliarAlso, I\u2019ve been playing since launch and have several dozen 5* heroes f2p so, while I hardly spent any money on this game, I recommend reserving spending to a last resort and after a lot of careful consideration...after all, gambling only stops being fun when you lose all your money</p>|I love this game. I haven\u2019t been playing Fire Emblem for long, and I started with Awakening, but even if I\u2019m not fully familiar with all the characters, I have a lot of fun collecting them. :^)) It\u2019s enjoyable when there are events lined up and good rewards to get, but there are break periods sometimes with nothing to do. It\u2019s not completely perfect, as it should be. Sometimes I feel that certain maps are too difficult and are appealing to \u2018whales\u2019, the extreme Pay to Play players, and my biggest problem is certain units that are very powerful and almost unable to be killed, like Instant Regnal Astra Ayra, but I don\u2019t encounter them often. But I believe some of the other hate isn\u2019t valid.THIS GAME IS ABOUT CHANCE. If you\u2019re summoning characters, you\u2019re taking a risk. That\u2019s the point, it\u2019s a gatcha, but it\u2019s definitely easier to play as F2P than a true Japanese gatcha game. Just having a 3% starting appearance rate is a blessing, compared to a 1% offered on other games. They do provide many opportunities to get orbs, it\u2019s just the player\u2019s choice to save them or use them. The game is pretty fair, and I think some of the bad reviews are just salty people who didn\u2019t get who they wanted. :^/ I do sometimes pay for orbs, and I\u2019ve had times where I didn\u2019t get the character I wanted, but I still continue to play. It\u2019s fun and worth trying! Don\u2019t be discouraged and stop playing when you don\u2019t get who you want because there are many other opportunities! \ud83d\udc95</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 87%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 65.4K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#156 in Strategy"}, {"size": "141.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/miniclip-com/id337457683?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "\u2022The World's #1 Pool game - now on iOS!\u2022Play with friends!

It\u2019s nothing but a way to earn money without charging to get the app. Example, when I first got on here, winning was easy. My shots lined up and I had no problem beating people as long as I took my time and lined the angles properly. Now that I got a taste of victory and 4 rings all the sudden the same angles don\u2019t work. I scratch more times here than at real pool and my opponent is hard shooting, breaking a cluster and his ball is finding a pocket without a scratch, not the case for me at all, maybe in the beginning. Now down to no coins and having to wait to play the 50 coin table I am tempted to by special offers etc. I will not!! This is a really sad way to make money when they have a ton of advertising going on. Really sad that you get handicapped to lure you to spend for a stupid free game!!! I\u2019m done with it!!Update!!! Played the worst hit the balls as hard as he could on every turn and never scratched, and was able to pocket a rack. I play with precision and take my time, hit very lightly most of the time and I scratched 4 times not counting the break so 5.

The quality is amazing, and the storyline and plot is great too! I love how you get to go to each professors class and learn about all the spells and potions, etc. I also like how they added some rivalry into the game (you\u2019ll figure out once you play), it makes it more interesting. One thing that I don\u2019t like though is that the energy runs out VERY fast. As you level up the energy limit gets a little higher but still it runs out within minuets once you start a lesson or activity. And it takes about a little over an hour to refill, and by the time it refills, your activity is over and you have to do it again because you couldn\u2019t complete it. One thing I recommend though if you\u2019re going to play this game, make sure you\u2019ve read the books because whenever you\u2019re in class, the professors will ask you questions regarding that class and the answers to those questions will be found in the books, for example: (In Madam Hooch\u2019s Class: What do you say to summon your broom without grabbing it? The answer is \u201cup\u201d) but if you haven\u2019t read the book you wouldn\u2019t know that because in the first book it says that in there. Other than that, this is great game. I recommend this game to all of the Harry Potter lovers out there! (But be aware that when you play, you won\u2019t go to Hogwarts with Harry and everyone else, the storyline takes place before Harry Potter arrives at Hogwarts).</p>|So far this game has been absolutely astounding. I love almost every single part of this game! It\u2019s fun, exciting, I loving going through the story and meeting the characters! Just the one part I don\u2019t like is how I have to have tokens to do everything. (I know they aren\u2019t tokens just not sure what they are called) I mean it\u2019s a good system and I\u2019m not sure if the further I progress I will get more but right now my Cap is 25. One refills ever 4 mins I believe. That\u2019s an Hour and a half of waiting to play the game when I could be playing it and going farther. I understand the system it\u2019s how you developers earn money. It\u2019s just the packs for them are insane. I can get 60 for around 200 gems. (I think I\u2019m not sure exactly how much it is just that it\u2019s a lot.) I could buy 200 for $10 but what happens when that runs out in just a matter of 10 mins. I don\u2019t want to pay every time I run out. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get across, I absolutely love this game, and I\u2019m going to keep playing, just maybe please fix the token system. Make them refill faster or give me the option to watch an add to refill some. I would happily do that because I love this game so much! Just having to wait is starting to annoy me and I don\u2019t want to have to stop for an hour  in the middle of learning a spell just so I can get more. Please if you read this try to fix it! Other then that thanks for such an amazing game! Great job!!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc</p>|Okay I love this game. I really enjoy playing, discovering new places, and meeting the many different characters etc., but today this game is really challenging my patience.   I am in year three and I have to finish the stinksap lesson in order to move on to the next chapter. I have played this lesson twice already today and I finished it both times, but after I collected the reward and left the classroom, it told me the lesson timed out and took away three house points both times..? Not to mention that it takes something close to fifty energy just to complete it once, which takes about an hour and a half to complete if I start out with a full energy bar of thirty. After I finished the lesson the first time, I was left with my energy bar completely drained and it took twenty minutes short of three hours to complete the second time. Now I have to start the lesson a third time with my energy drained AGAIN, and who knows if it will actually work this time. If it doesn\u2019t work it will take three more house points away. I\u2019m just imagining the different ways that I can smash my iPad because this is extremely frustrating..\ud83d\ude16 Anyway, this is mostly a rant and I apologize for that.  This really is a great game, and I love all little details and backstories that I\u2019ve learnt throughout it.

Adding new 3 and 4 star monsters like every time a patch comes out would be cool 3.Some people say not to waste crystals on the crystal summon, but I have way too many to spare. Anyways if there was an added crystal summon that was like 100something crystals it would give lightning, like a lightning crystal summon. 4. And maybe just buff the rates of getting a nat 5 by a little.~Story~ I accidentally fed the light Lich over 3 months ago then in chat I saw some people talking about an account rollback, so I asked what it was and they explained that if you accidentally feed or sell something you email hive about it and they roll your account back to a previous point in time (Only back a month). It would be impossible to acquire the runes and monsters you have gotten in that point of time. 5. If it would work, and for the player to be satisfied the most, just restore the monster. It could be just a screenshot taken from google, but (I\u2019m guessing you go into the account) you would be able to see they had that monster and restore it or (if its possible) put it in their next scroll that they summon. I fed my Halaphas, you could put him in the next  L&amp;D scroll that I summon. Those are just my opinions, but overall I love the game. Great Work!</p>|This is a game I always end up coming back to, it\u2019s a very welcoming and well developed for a mobile game. The events are wonderful and seem to take into account newer players into account when they release them, so they aren\u2019t left out of great rewards. It contains a wide variety of monsters to use and deep strategy to building the right team for each of the modes. Definitely something I would recommend at-least trying for a while before you make a decision on the game for it can take a second to really get started a get a sense of what you are doing. But afterwards you really start to take on the challenge of building a strong team and improving you monsters. There are many guilds and helpful players in the community though which is a very fascinating, because it can be very hard to Find a healthy community in games. There are a couple of negatives I find with the game and developers though, as the micro transactions are insanely expensive and you\u2019ll get them flashed on your screen quite a bit while you navigate the menus, you can easily just click them away though. And rising in pvp ranks can be quite a hassle as there are many lvl 50 players who just sit in the lower ranks with max lvl monsters as their defense, which makes it very frustrating for newer and mid level players to climb. All in all I am very satisfied with this game and will always come back it. \ud83d\ude00</p>|I recently looked at my own profile and I\u2019ve been playing this game since June 2014. So this game is fun it amusing and you can have a great time playing for how ever long you want because believe me with as much as you can strive to get it won\u2019t end and you will be better or worse than someone else or just play computer grind forever. However if you take this game at all serious and if you even try to pay occasionally you won\u2019t really make a great difference. Put it this way me and my brother have played this game since 2014 and occasionally put in some money about $100 a year since we play it more than some store bought game but $400 down the road we are average players.To the point this game isn\u2019t free to play, pay to play it\u2019s for those who spend above hundreds maybe thousands. The players who are above average complete things faster and get more prizes basically the more you play you can do good but those in the top 10 % they just  get more and more because they do so well especially in new content like the labyrinth that no one can beat. You can save up on this game for months I saved for five months and spent money got nothing. I\u2019m about to rage quit but I\u2019ve spent more than a game system over time. Just look at the world tournaments this game has online mist of the people could have bought houses for what they say  they put into this game and announcers seem to take pride in this during the tournaments</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 65%;", "one_star": "width: 12%;", "star": "4.2, 13.2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#182 in Strategy"}, {"size": "162.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/fun-games-for-free/id618574061?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The ORIGINAL coloring book!

And I have many tiny problems that most likely,other people have to. My first problem is: \u201cPremium.\u201d Now before you start saying stuff like, \u201cUgh we just are tryna keep our profit.\u201d Or something like that, listen to my WHOLE review. So, here\u2019s the thing I hate about \u201cPremium.\u201d You can\u2019t import pictures without \u201cPremium.\u201d You can\u2019t compose your stuff without \u201cPremium.\u201d But I have lotssss more. What also isn\u2019t fair is that if you don\u2019t have stupid \u201cPremium.\u201d You have to do the same picture over and over until like 4 weeks later they replace them. My next problem: Pictures. I\u2019ve found people tryna make the pictures look,  ini-propionate. And for the youngsters out there, they\u2019ll think it\u2019s okay to do that. Do you want them to grow up like that? I suppose you said \u201cNo.\u201d I think you should make a system to check the pictures they made and see if there appropriate, and not nude. And if they are you should give them like \u201cstrike 1.\u201d If they do it once. And if they do something not appropriate or nude again,kick them off so other people won\u2019t follow them and think \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d My last problem: Comments. I really love the pictures other people make,but I\u2019m not aloud to have Facebook. Sometimes I feel like older people get to comment because there more mature. So I have a lot of reasons to delete this game. Please reply back. ~Your true friend who is kind of mad,Bree \u2764\ufe0f</p>|Look, I love this app! It\u2019s super addictive, but I don\u2019t like how you have to have a membership to do cool stuff.

I want to use the turquoise colors, and do mandalas!! WITHOUT A MEMBERSHIP!!! I understand that this is how they make money, but $24 a month is outrageous!!! If you can please LOWER the price!!! Me and my BFF love this app, and we love getting likes on our photos, once she even got MOST LOVED, the top photos of the day!!! The one thing I would change is the outrageous price and all the things they keep away from you in the membership!!! Otherwise, I love spending my weekends coloring!!! But everyone, take a stand with me!!! LOWER THE MEMBERSHIP PRICES!!! Thank you for reading this!!! I know it was long and now I\u2019m making it longer saying this, but almost the entire thing was me complaining!! Just know, it is a great app, and now if you\u2019re thinking, \u201cMaybe not this app\u201d, NO!!! GET THIS APP!! If you\u2019re willing to pay $24 monthly, great!!!

I give it a 5 because it feeds my ADD and I can gamble without spending money. What's with all the cats though?  You have Fancy Cats, Fantasy Cats, Outlaw Kitten and even a couple of Pink Panthers( also a cat) in there. The closest thing to a dog is Wild Howl and that involves Rabbits, Moose and Owls.  So why no dog themed games?  Dogs are great.  Lots of breeds of dogs to spin off slots.  I mean think how popular Dog Shows are.  You have endless dog slot machine possibilities here. Working Dogs, hero Dogs, packs of Dogs, puppies, water Dogs etc. Since I have now ignited the untapped dog slot possibilities I only request that you keep the toy poodles and little chihuahua yip yip dogs out of it.  They are too much like cats.  Loud yippy cats.  You already have enough cats in your lineup.Update July 2018. STILL NO DOGS?!  Mostly air brained Stupid scantily clad fantasy like women, (might have one completely dressed man in the mix).  Lots of pirate type, genie, leprechaun, eagles annnnnd Cat themed games!  I\u2019m just asking you to have some Dog themed slot game.  I\u2019m sure people are like what\u2019s upwith this person and the dog campaign? Dogs are cool!  And I just want to see if your audience has any input in your creativity. Seriously if you do make one stay away from the toy poodle yip yip dogs. Anyway I\u2019m still having mindless fun playing your silly app.</p>|Truly my favorite slot games of all that I\u2019ve tried but payouts are so poor that I literally have to wait until I collect enough coins to play for a short period of time. Can\u2019t play long or you will never be able to accrue enough coins to compete in challenges.  I just try to collect all coin offers and build up a little each day.  At this rate it will take me a couple of months before I have enough coins to comfortably play and enjoy my fave games without losing most of my coins  The Facebook and Email coins (22,500) offered are ridiculously small in comparison to other slot games and also compared to typical bets (300,00 to 450,000 coins for me). The daily, etc. challenges are very hard to complete without a huge bankroll of coins. Even the special challenges they offer, while entertaining, are extremely difficult so I almost feel cheated in that so few seem to actually complete and win the ultimate prize, judging by the complaints.  Other slot games seem to be stepping up with more challenges and better games so we\u2019ll see what happens but Caesar\u2019s needs to increase the free coin offers and loosen the slots to be more competitive with others.  PS: When I first started playing the slots payed relatively well.  My guess is they somehow give better payouts to new customers, but it only lasts long enough for you to find the games you enjoy and then they tighten up and you lose, lose, lose.  Too bad because they really do have great games.</p>|I love this game. I had it on Windows Phone, and have been playing for years now, after having switched to iOS. I loved that they supported WP7/8/10, as well as being able to play via Facebook. The slots are a ton of fun, the highest quality of any available on the App Store, and the constant updates are a pleasure, especially after so many years.To all those who complain about low payouts, it\u2019s a game of luck, and sometimes you just don\u2019t get lucky, other times you do. I remember when I hit 10 million the first time, back when I was a lower level and 10k per spin was a lot. A few months go by and then get up to 100 million, after weeks of just collecting every four hours and saving over a day or so, waiting until I have enough to spin 10-20 the times where the payout would be big if I hit it, and eventually you do. A couple weeks ago I got on a hot streak and got over 4 billion coins, starting from around 10 million ( I\u2019m a high enough level that my daily take in free coins is around 10-20 million). That lasted a week and a half, and now I\u2019m down to nothing, but I\u2019ll keep collecting the daily free coins and eventually hit big again. Have patience and have fun.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 85%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.7, 58.4K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#26 in Casino"}, {"size": "231.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/n3twork-inc/id766104536?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Legendary: Game of Heroes is a card game, RPG, and match 3 game all combined into one.

Have run into some glitches here and there, but they are always quick to get them sorted and provide in-game compensation for any missed or incomplete-able content. And I do find it can be very taxing on the iPhone 6 battery, especially with the volume turned up.The last update brought some awesome QOL features that I really appreciate, especially hero ability queuing. I do hope they bring some customization to the notifications in a future update.The game picks up at rank 15, which unlocks events. You will spend ranks 1 to 15 getting familiar with the mechanics and acquiring gems. I highly recommend holding onto the gems until you can do events. Between events, the daily dungeon, pvp, guild wars, the gear dungeon, the main campaign and more, there is a ton of content to experience.For those who don\u2019t mind to spend a few bucks there is the hero pass and elite hero pass that can help you along the way and I highly recommend getting them at the \u201cnew player\u201d prices. While absolutely not required, it can be fun to splurge on a few extra packs for that chance at additional hero\u2019s. For me throwing a few bucks their way to say \u201cGood Job\u201d was a no brainer. There is a lot to enjoy from the game both in mechanics and artwork, but do expect to loose a few hours of your day having fun battling away!</p>|Love this game. Came across it on an add from a different game and honestly I play it daily. I\u2019ve deleted other games because not nearly as fun. I rated this as 4 stars because mine has some glitches that make it less fun. In the gear dungeon- caves of (starts with an s) mine always freezes and shuts the whole game down. So I lose the key and never seem to get anything and considering this level takes forever it makes it a giant waste of time to try and play it. When playing the puzzle game it will move things the wrong way occasionally or not let you change pieces and you end up like wasting a turn. Biggest pet peeve is the \u201crandom\u201d pick of hero\u2019s you get when you buy a pack. I almost never get anything but earth characters. Or I get the same only three star card over and over. Plus earning pieces to upgrade you character takes forever to achieve.

THE BEAR     (HAVE FUN EVERONE)</p>|I have been playing this game off and on for a few years now. I absolutely love the Wizard Of Oz and I love that this game is in perfect sync with the movie. What I don't love is that even with the hourly coins and completing challenges I still end up buying coins with real money. (My choice I know) I really WANT to play this game but it literally took me 8 months to complete a set of card stars after playing almost everyday!! I lose so much more than I win. I hate that. There is no fun in that. If I wanted to lose real money I would go to Vegas and order a drink to spin my paycheck away. Also, I would like to know how in the world the same 3 people seem to continue to hit the jackpot around 3-4 times an hour after a few years???? Come on!! At least change the supposed winners names so it at least looks realistic to us that are wishing that we were the ones hitting the jackpot when in reality we can't even afford to bet anywhere near the minimum bet to even have a chance at winning it. But really, I have played every penny I had for days (after buying coins) and never even got a chance to spin the \"bonus wheel\" or hit even the minor jackpot.... Up your winnings! Plain and simple. This is a game, not Vegas. Me and my bank account will thank you. Maybe I'll have enough cash to pay for some Wizard Of Oz Slots anonymous!</p>|I have been attempting to collect my \"Rise and Shine\" bonus in the mornings and I am getting an error once the game opens that states something similar to \"Oops. Something went wrong. Try again later.\" This has been happening for the last 7 calendar days. So I have been unable to collect my bonus. Also, when collecting my  streak bonus, the little icon in the bottom right corner says \"Collect Bonus 1,740,000 streak bonus Day ## +550,000\" when I click on it to collect it shows \"Daily Bonus 1,450,000 + Streak Bonus 550,000 + VIP Bonus 290,000 = 2,290,000\" Which does not add up. If my Daily Bonus shows me 1,740,000 and my streak bonus is 550,000 and I am eligible for a VIP Bonus of 290,000 then that equals 2,580,000. Not the 2,290,000 that I have been getting. I have done all updates when offered. If this is not the case then it should not show I am eligible for a Daily Bonus of 1,740,000 AND a Streak Bonus of 550,000. It should just show Daily Bonus of 1,450,000. This has been going on for a while. Which I initially thought I missed an update so when I was offered the next update I took it. This did not resolve the issue. I have screen shots of everything. Contemplating deleting the game. I have stopped purchasing from the game because I feel why should I spend my money if I'm being cheated out of daily bonuses offered.

I\u2019ve only been using the app for three days and I have given up. I understand that the app works fine if you pay for a subscription, however, developers should understand that not everyone can afford to pay a monthly fee just to watch anime. If they\u2019re going to offer a free alternative and make you watch ads to compensate, the least they could do is make sure the free version actually works- otherwise just don\u2019t offer it! Don\u2019t make people waste their time! The first day this app worked great- I don\u2019t care if I have to watch ads or even if the ads repeat. I understand it\u2019s free so I don\u2019t mind it. However, yesterday, I started to notice that the app freezes whenever an ad is about to play- the screen goes black and that\u2019s it. There is nothing you can do but exit the app and restart it. Initially this only happened a few times, but now it\u2019s to the point I can\u2019t even START watching an episode because it freezes. I can restart the app 12 times (which I have), and it does the exact same thing each time. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done using this app, wasting my time and dealing with this frustration. And now, even if I could or wanted to, there is NO WAY I\u2019m ever going to give my money to Crunchyroll. If you\u2019re going to give a free service and make it as crappy as possible just to get people to buy the subscription- don't even offer it to begin with. It\u2019s low, a cheap trick. Just don\u2019t.</p>|Ugh! Ad overload. On each of the episodes i get 9 ads to 15 ads! We should get 6 at the most ads instead! A lot of my friends are persistent and don\u2019t buy the crunchyroll premium membership because they know that its all worthless and cost too much money in a year. I have an idea Crunchyroll, make the person watching anime have an option. When they go on their first episode, they could be given the choice to watch all the ads at once ( addition ads if you want probably 1 addition ad ) because you get bad reviews because people want to get rid of the ad first! If you want some money, you could make it cost $0.99. It works! I told my friends about this and I asked them, \u201c would you buy this deal,\u201d they of course agreed because it is a fair price for the option to get rid of the ads first rather than watching \u201c barbeque ads \u201c while a moment of crying  ( I deleted some of the review but now that I have crunchyroll premium it puts a different mood to the anime and it\u2019s super nice, though next time for crunchyroll regular membership, you should add the advertisements to be about that anime if possible or atleast about anime only )</p>|Crunchyroll publishes awesome anime. But the app has an identity crisis. Login with a paid subscriber account and everything works great. Five stars. Seriously. It is very well done. But \u2014 and this is huge \u2014 not everyone can afford the monthly fees and the execution of the advertising ruins the app. No stars. Crunchyroll needs the advertising to fund the delivery of no-cost anime to its free subscribers. It is the TV broadcasting business  model. No problem.  But the technology used to insert the ads fails to match the quality of the overall app. The ads lock up the app. They also repeat themselves three times in a row in the same ad break. And while the ads are supposed to be targeted to the interests of the viewers, they are not. If Crunchyroll could get the advertising to work correctly, advertising could possibly make more money per user than paid subscriptions.  Determining the interests of viewers is pretty easy. You just ask them. Do interesting ads and people will click them.  Streaming technology is good enough to never lock up an app.  And never repeat ads during the same break. I will never buy a Volvo no matter how many times you run the ad. I'm a Subaru guy.  You should already know that. Have Subaru tell me about its awesome technology and I will click the ad to find out more info.  Everyone wins \u2014 Crunchyroll, advertisers and anime fans.

I feel like I am limping through with no incentive to continue.  Not willing to spend any more money for helps...I usually end up spending hours and days trying to complete a level and move forward.  Recently, I deleted Soda and can honestly say that I am considering deleting Jelly...sadly.  So I would like to suggest that some levels should be easy to complete before the Hard and Super Hard levels appear.  The daily bonus is not daily when there is no bonus on the first day.  Also, thank your players from time to time.  We support you and quite honestly....we don't hear from you.  I wrote this review some time ago.  The regular levels are still more than difficult...only once in awhile is there something that I beat on the first try.  Also, your daily bonus has not been fixed...it\u2019s time for an update.  Now, I don\u2019t usually see the daily bonus and out of 7 days you still only get 6.  On the plus side though, you do thank your players by giving them extra playing time and that is appreciated.</p>|I have been a fan of the original Candy Crush as well as Candy Crush Soda for many years and consider myself an experienced player. I have been playing this Jelly game for a couple months now and it\u2019s technically too difficult at times and it causes me to either stop playing, or leaving that particular level to try the next one because it\u2019s simply impossible to succeed in it. I won\u2019t get into the specifics here, but there are things that make the game too difficult, if not impossible to pass to the next level. I understand that it takes practice to get a stride going on some levels, but after playing it numerous times now, I have come to the conclusion that it\u2019s just not possible to fix a level once you\u2019ve done something that makes it impossible to turn it around and gain your stride again. I\u2019m disappointed with this game. I keep going back to it because it\u2019s actually really fun and a good challenge, but it takes things too far sometimes.</p>", "four_star": "width: 23%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 66%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.5, 17.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#104 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "184.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mlb/id281969992?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "At Bat \u2013 the #1 source for live baseball on your iPhone and iPad \u2013 Is the official app of Major League Baseball.**** AT BAT SUBSCRIPTIONS ****At Bat offers two subscription options for its extensive premium features, covering live MLB games from Opening Day to the World Series.- Yearly recurring fee of $19.99.- Monthly recurring fee of $2.99.- MLB.TV All Teams subscribers receive At Bat\u2019s premium features for free.**** 2019 FEATURES ****(NOTE: Additional features and functionality will be available in regular app updates throughout the season.

Over the years the app has been glitchy but last season it really came around and continued through the 2018 all-star break this season. It must have been the most recent update because for the last couple of weeks it takes me two or three app restarts just to get my game playing. And I\u2019m only talking about the radio/audio version. I am not interested in game day or video. I cannot even get this app to work like an a.m. radio! Then after a couple of minutes it cuts out and gives me an \u201cauthorization failure\u201d message - restart again. If this isn\u2019t resolved by the end of the season, next year I am purchasing the tune in app to listen to my games.UPDATE!!I used the \u201ccontact us\u201d link in the app and was able to get help that completely solved my problem! I ended up uninstalling the app, restarting my phone, and then reinstalling the app. Everything works great now! Thank you!</p>|First off, I do really like this app. I enjoy being able to read news and see scores about my favorite team. I decided to purchase the $20 in app purchase because I wanted to be able to watch full games. I do not have access to cable or satelite tv. When my team had its first spring training game a couple days ago, I tried to play the game and it says MLBtv subscription required. Now, I don\u2019t know if it was because it\u2019s spring training or if it\u2019s because I misunderstood the apps purchase, but I would like to know exactly what it is I am paying $20 a year for if I cannot watch live games. I want to add that I still enjoy the app and that I am not going to delete the app and I still find this a good resource, but I think that MLB should make a disclaimer for others who have the same impression...another idea is to add this to the $20 or make a separate in app purchase for live games. A student discount would also be a good idea. I hope this review helps others</p>|I listen to my own broadcasters all season but when we get to the playoffsI have to listen to the national broadcast.  What is this 1980 something?!?  I don't care what the national guys have to say and when it's not my team I could see the home town broadcast could get annoying.  So I use this app to try and synch up with my tv and listen to the same play by plan and color guys I hear all year. If you could enhance the app to synch with the tv so I could use your app to listen to my guys I would use it all the time and I'm sure I'm not the only one.  So national would get the ad revenue from tv advertising and you could start to sell your broadcast to local markets because you would increase your base significantly.  Just add a button to synch with the tv and you'd have something awesome.  You could also charge a premium for this because I'd pay at least $10 for the post season to avoid these guys...Thanks for reading... now back to the cubs and trying to stomach Ernie Johnsons play by play...</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 83%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.6, 35.3K Ratings", "category": "Sports", "sub_rank": "#18 in Sports"}, {"size": "900.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/gameloft/id282764297?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Create the Disney Park of your dreams, filled with beloved Disney characters, exciting attractions and special events!

As a die-hard Disney fan, I do love the concept of getting to build my own theme park with all my favorite characters but in classic Disney style it\u2019s all about money. For starters, it seems there\u2019s some characters you can only get from chests that cost real money, and you\u2019re not even guaranteed to get one if you buy the chests! Second, the costs to do anything (unlock land, build a building, etc) are astronomical, and (so far) the currency you earn doesn\u2019t scale appropriately. You get very little from these quests that take 12 hours! Then, it\u2019s nearly impossible to progress because there\u2019s just a series of doors in your face. It\u2019s like, you have to unlock a character to progress, so you do the same 6 hour quest a ton of times until you get the items. Then you do one quest with that character, and for the next one, you have to build a building. But you have to level up the character to build the building, and the whole process starts over. I don\u2019t mind in-app purchases, can\u2019t complain about that, especially when an app is free. But, it should be set up so that people who don\u2019t spend real money can still progress at a reasonable rate, and can have access to characters without them hiding behind a pay-to-unlock wall. This app needs to make some major changes lol.</p>|I just wanna say that I\u2019ve been playing this game since I was 12 (so about 2 years ) and I will admit that this game is good, and that games do need to make money (for instance I love hearthstone as the game is reasonable pay to win) but this game is just RIDICULOUS, you have to pay 10 dollars for an exclusive character like Jack Sparrow, now that is just TOO much, this game has a lot of potential even though you have to grind for endless hours just too get one piece of land, welcome a character that takes months to get all the tokens for, then send them on 2 quests and WHOOPS you have to upgrade them again, and don\u2019t get excited about getting chests you wait 6 hours for, they just give you crappy tokens you don\u2019t need, plus the premium chests cost 10 bucks just to have a 2% chance of getting the thing you want. There is one huge solution to this game I\u2019ve thought of (besides an actual meaningful story) release Marvel and Star Wars characters that can be obtainable for EVERYONE, this would be great as it would provide a good infusion of variance and well-loved characters into the game (an avengers 4 and Star Wars 9 event would be great) these could be great ways to improve the game, and gameloft I hope your listening (you probably aren\u2019t because your such a big company) but I hope you are because this could save this potentially amazing game.</p>|I\u2019ve been playing DMK for the past 3 years and I progressed a LOT into the game and I almost had everything and every now and then I even invested money into the game, for example, when I needed a legendary chest for a character that isn\u2019t out yet and stuff. It really is magical and the best game I have ever played! BUUUUT about almost a year ago my phone started acting up or more like the app was closing randomly after it freezes but I realized that I just needed to update my iOS. I didn\u2019t update until after I had my progress lost for good. Yes I did connect through Facebook AND Game Center but when I tried to log back onto my game it started me off from the VERY BEGINNING OF THE GAME. My phone had frozen and the game closed by itself and...my progress and everything I worked for it? Gone. I tried so many things to get it back including signing back in 1000 times, contacting support, commenting on fb posts in hopes of a reply and nothing. I became very upset after that and stopped playing. I literally didn\u2019t even bother to start over and I didn\u2019t get the guts to play DMK again until my cousins encouraged me yesterday (more than half a year later). I\u2019m gaining the confidence to slowly rebuild my whole kingdom again but geez that problem REALLY UPSET me. If it wasn\u2019t for that, I would have given this game 5 stars. \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude12</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 81%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 70.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#51 in Family"}, {"size": "256.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/zynga-inc/id295913422?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Join the world\u2019s most popular Poker game with more tables, more tournaments, and more people to challenge than ever before.

What are they for and what. Can you do with them. No where is it explain what they are good for once you obtained them. I still haven\u2019t received a answer to my question about the tickets. The game is very good and enjoyable. The only problem I have is that there is always a problem getting rid into the game. It is unbelievable that there is no seats available at the table especially when I do get on there are open seats at the table. The game is very enjoyable.. as of now I am trying to play and I am being told that there isn\u2019t empty seats. How is that possible when I do get to play there is always a empty fifth seat open.

Very good</p>|Save yourself the frustration of using this app. I\u2019ve been playing off and on and have done fairly well. Problem is there are so many bad beats and when I say so many I mean several times in a single tournament. I have a straight got beat with a flush. Some had 4 queens I beat them with 4 kings. I have AK same suit on the flop I pair both up and lose to someone who stayed in with a 2 clubs 4 spade beats me with a flush to the 2 of clubs. Game is just terrible. They need a more realistic algorithm rather than driving down your stack so you purchase chips. So I have been reading the threads about the bad beats and how the algorithm is luring you in. So here\u2019s the what I found after playing it based on what I\u2019ve read. In these rooms your not playing all actually people. The computer fronts as a real person and the algorithm is designed to detect your favorite cards. It deals you in so the computer can beat you. For example I hade trips with 7\u2019s and the computer beat me with a straight. The computer stayed in with a 6 and 8 unsuited hit the straight on the flop. After I loss it said \u201cbuy more chips\u201d then I went to lower the bet to test the theory again very next hand happened again. This time the flop and river had pair of 6\u2019s pair is Aces computer won Q high. If you wanna play to pass the time then this is the game other than that. Never ever buy chips it the greatest scam going. Out of all the online poker games I\u2019ve played this is the worse one.</p>|I played this back when it was first created and was extremely popular. I quit because of douche betters who go all in all the time. We get it. Douche betters don't know how to play and think luck will be on their side every single hand. \ud83d\ude44 The thing I liked about the old version was the chat window was still on the screen while playing so you could interact if you wanted to. In the new version, the chat window gets in the way and you have no time to chat and play at the same time. Not that I like chatting, I prefer to keep to myself. But it is annoying that if I want to say something, I risk missing a hand. The main reason I give 2 stars is because the game is glitchy. I've been playing the three round games, but it never saves the info if you win the round. So it starts you at the round 1 again even if you should be in round 2. But sometimes it will randomly show that I'm in round two and I play. But if I win, it starts me at round 1 again. It should automatically start you in the next round if you wish to play again. The glitch is annoying. There should also be a faster way of getting rid of the players who join a table and never play. I get that maybe they lost connection or something, but they should be booted out sooner. It's a waste of time.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.6, 29.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#25 in Casino"}, {"size": "148.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/camelgames-inc/id1298915028?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Orc Knights, Elf Sages, Dragon Riders, and other incredible warriors are waiting to fight for your empire!

I have been addicted since I got it 4 months ago, anyone who hasn\u2019t tried this please get it, this is now the only game that I play. If you\u2019re looking for something to invest time in without spending a lot of money this is the game for you, I\u2019ve never had one single complaint about this game, absolutely fantastic. Developers please don\u2019t change a thing, I\u2019ve never been so proud of a company for holding on to its original goals without changing to gain more money from players, what an absolutely amazing company, I\u2019m looking forward to what you add next, please keep the game as is overall, it\u2019s excellent and game mechanics are flawless. I apologize for the long rambling but I just love this game, thank you for reading my post. This game is not pay to win, I currently lead a rank 3 alliance at 40 million power and I haven\u2019t spent one penny in my new realm, it\u2019s all about learning how to play without spending all of your money, this company deserves to get compensated however I will begin spending when I\u2019m able to. Thank you for making such an amazing game I would be heartbroken if I wasn\u2019t able to play it in the future, please don\u2019t change a thing.</p>|So I like this game except I have one problem. In my first account, I sent my whole army to defend an alliance flag. I was kicked from the Alliance for no reason and there was no way to get my army back. So, I deleted the game. I got it again months later and I have a lvl 10 city and have unlocked tier 4 soldiers (highest for lvl 10 city) but I have learned to not reinforce anyone. I think you should be able to set the territory tax amount higher or lower than 15%. I also think it should be easier to get an alliance castle and it should be were a leader isn\u2019t demoted until 20 instead of 3 days, since the leader could be on vacation or something. I also think there should be more than two races per soldier category. It should be more than the current two races per category. I am listing the current races per soldier category(Infantry: humans orcs, cavalry: dragon riders and horseback, Archers: humans and elves, mages: humans and elves. Also make more monster types there is only like 4. I\u2019m also only on tier 12 monsters and they are way overpowered they defeated my whole army of 20K men 1-4 tier, and my dragon was part of the army, and it was only a Cerberus thing. By the way my in game name is Micenia.</p>|The game itself is not bad though if you wanna grow you need to either be a huge spender or joining an alliance and be a dedicated member , growing alone is very hard especially when you are playing in a realm with lots of Chinese and Koreans that are constantly  cheating or spending! But now that 3 realms have been merged in to one realm as ream # 187  it\u2019s even harder to grow !  Now we have to fight over lvl 2 and 3 gem mins where we didn\u2019t even think of them as worthy of attention , rss tiles are scarce and won\u2019t  answer the need of us anymore , it\u2019s hard to grow without gathering and or spending .we are constantly fighting over territory , the first big  alliance wanna have big territories even for their farms!  Some alliances have merged together and now harassing small ones , many of my comrades and friends  have left the game  because they got zeroed  because  the other alliance attacked us with 55 members after Kill Event ! Everything is a total mess , an alliance got wiped put  and its members are now joined  with the big 3 or scattered around the map .and recently after this newly update my own castle and some of my friends have been randomly teleported to the borders of the alliance !  What on earth is this stupid thing ! It\u2019s ridiculous!  That\u2019s why i gave a 2 star !

So far the game hasn\u2019t crashed or frozen.  (I\u2019m at level 295.) 2. Ads aren\u2019t as annoyingly long\u2014 as is the case with some games. 3. Ads offer variety \u2014 they aren\u2019t ALWAYS or MOST ALWAYS about how great it is to play a different game \u2014 then forcing the player to pretend-play it before returning to the original game. Minus: 1.  Game doesn\u2019t recognize some words [ex. lee - the side (of something, a building, a boat) that is sheltered from the wind]. 2. Stingy with \u201ccoins.\u201d [[ Okay, this is just my opinion. I\u2019m at level 295 - have 1,195 \u201ccoins.\u201d  A player earns coins when opening the game for the first time of day -a \u201cdaily\u201d prize - amount varies - 25 max as far as I can tell; 25 of these coins at the end of each 16-levels [game is designed to advance through theme-named steps - each with 16 levels in it] and by submitting \u201cextra\u201d words (not used in in crossword-style puzzle) - this is the one I think is \u201ccheap\u201d because a player gets only ONE coin for each extra word - and sometimes there are only few unused words that are even possible - I\u2019ve gone through several levels earning 0 coins!). [Might be more ways\u2014 I haven\u2019t fully explored the game\u2019s features \u2014 I don\u2019t bother with \u201ctournaments,  etc.]. When hints  \u201ccost\u201d 100 \u201ccoins\u201d I think allowing only 1 coin per extra word is stingy. And why not give a coin or two just for successfully finishing each of the 16 levels\u2014 just to allow for a FEW (at 100 coins each) hint purchases?  ]]</p>|I use to LOVE this game! I played frequently every day and looked forward to the weekend challenge to earn coins. I reached level 2464 and now I hate this game more than I can say in words here. I am so frustrated and angry because the game keeps freezing every few minutes. This has been an ongoing, continuous problem now for 4 weeks. It\u2019s blown any and every chance of winning the weekend tournament each week in addition to other coins for extra words which I always find many! I\u2019ve lost hundreds of coins due to the hanging and freezing and have potentially lost thousands! I contacted support immediately! Kenny takes time to reply and he never addressed specifically my problem loss of coins. He hasn\u2019t replied to my latest response to him in over a weeks! Unprofessional is the least of what this is. He had asked if I had the \u2018free\u2019 version with banners at the bottom. I downloaded the only version available in thee  App Store, and at the time I responded back to him, I saw no bottom banners because they, too, were hanging and not appearing. The loss of hundreds of coins, problem NOT fixed after 4 weeks, lack of timely reply to me, and no compensation for my troubles nor even addressing this AT ALL is why I give this game 1 star vs 5. I\u2019d give it a big fat zero if I could.</p>|Puzzles are decent. Adds are annoying, like any app.  After playing this for a few weeks, reaching level 800+, I\u2019ve noticed several times I enter a word that IS VALID, but the game won\u2019t accept it - even as a bonus word.  Yet, it will recognize odd words that are not common in the English language.  Can\u2019t recall any as an example, but when the word is clicked to see the definition, it is of foreign or ancient origin.  Nice to learn new words, but it should know every word combination possible from the letters provided. Hence, my 4 star review.  Should be 3.5 stars. Also, if you don\u2019t know the meaning of a word, don\u2019t make it the last word entered into the puzzle- Because, after the final word is entered, the screen clears and does not provide the player an opportunity to look up the meaning of the last word.   Here\u2019s a prime example.  Take the letters.  F H C I E Y L.    It doesn\u2019t know chiel, chyle, fiche ... ceil, elhi, fley, flic, fyce,heil, lech, lich, lief, lych, yech. ....... then there is TAU. 19th letter of Greek alphabet, is the first definition.   Right.....   now that I\u2019ve played for quite a length of time, I finally clicked the shopping cart, as I have over 21,000 coins.  Come to find out, can\u2019t purchase anything with just the coins.. need to spend real money too!  What a crock.

I first found it on my tablet about like maybe 3-4 years ago while I was looking for Marvel games on the App Store, then I came across Marvel Future Fight. Now all I was looking for was a simple game that you can play as Captain America in, but I came across much more than that. When I first downloaded it, it took a bit for it to finish updating the game like when you first download it, it has to update. When it finished I made myself an account. I started with Iron Man and Black Widow, then I defeated Captain America and I was so happy that I got him because back then, he was my favorite character from Marvel. But I noticed that back then it\u2019s much much more difficult to get good characters, now days once you enter the game you get a character chooser (I forgot what they\u2019re called) Anyways that was 3-4 years ago lol, by now I have deleted and reinstalled the game many times, and have a full 6 red star team that includes the following characters: Thor, Dormammu, Destroyer Promethius. I got my Dormammu fairly recently like a couple months ago. It is obviously much stronger than Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. I know a lot of people who read this might stop because it\u2019s so long but if you did read it all please send me a friend request in game my name in it is PvPGod404. Thanks in advance.\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude42</p>|I have been playing this game since there were about fifteen characters and journalistic integrity was by far the best team ever. Recently I started another account and saw what the new player rewards were. They are insane, not just because they are almost as good as what I have worked so hard on, and even spent real money for, but starting with a ten dollar purchase odor free and ending with two more differnt ten dollar packs it also has some nose supply\u2019s and gives you hero\u2019s journey which used to be one of the worst character selection screens ever now holds captain America, Sharon Rodgers and is now awesome, alongside two 6 star six mastery characters with no effort, and about 8 million gold this is about what I had after years of playing in a week if you are smart. The reason this is four stars is because me as one of the older players in the game haven\u2019t gotten any of it. Dial it down for new players or give that bonus to players who started before that was an option. Before people say I was just bad and that\u2019s why I was no good try doing up to chapter six in missions with a two star captain America and one star iron man and black widow. This was also before striker bonuses whith them so they wouldn\u2019t fly out and hit enemies when playing as a different character, also this was before I was easy to level characters up and before thay gave out exp chips and there was only one iso-8 daily mission entry. That is what I did.</p>|First off, I deleted MCOC the very second I played this game! This game rocks! Very versatile and keeps me interested. Heres where I go from 5-4*. The torso posture 90% of the characters is so wrong. Many will laugh at me for pointing this out. My background is in Kinesiology, Reflexology, Personal Training, Massage Therapy, &amp; Chiropractic. Anyways, almost every character looks as though they were born into a desk job. Tucked in tailbones, scroll the character to the side and you wonder how some heros can even stand up. Now I get it that the makers of this games job is the looks of the character to the comics/movies and create cool looking special moves and basic fighting skills, so posture prolly flew out the window of concern. But when your players look as though a stiff breeze could blow them over, well, thats not very heroic or frightening.(based on hero or villain). In the future(fight), please do not model super hero's and villains posture after office employees. Another strange thing is some of the math displayed in the purchase area/screen. While it says 600 above where you get 20 biometirics daily for 30 days which equals 600, in \u201cTony Starks Stash\u201d it says 2450 for getting 75 crystals daily for 30 days which adds up to 2250. Simple math. Anyways, please talk with a personal trainer about posture, do some tweaks so that the characters look as their posture should, and thank you for the great game!</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 63%;", "one_star": "width: 19%;", "star": "4.0, 12.1K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#104 in Role Playing"}, {"size": "174.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/aniplex-inc/id884966694?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "A new mobile \"Fate RPG,\" presented by TYPE-MOON!With an impressive main scenario and multiple character quests, the game features millions of words of original story!Packed with content that both fans of the Fate franchise and newcomers will be able to enjoy.Summary2017 A.D.

Now usually when it comes to a gacha game it's implied that the more stars tacked onto something the better it is. This is where Fate/GO alters from the rest of the gacha scene as a whole, in that just about any servant can be viable given team composition and craft essence attached to them. By far the best example of this comes in the form of 3 star lancer c\u00fa chulainn. While c\u00fa may have lower stats than 4 and 5 star units, his skills are what make him so amazing. With out going into depth on c\u00fa's skills I'll just summarize with that they essentially make him unkillable if you use them wisely. C\u00fa is so good that he actually makes some 4 star units look bad in comparison. As for craft essences there are many that have similar effects with various levels of bonuses depending on rank, but there are still many unique craft essences in the 3-5 star range that can find use on just about any servant. The point of this long block of texts is just to say that stars don't define what is good or bad in this game. Don't be afraid to play around with low star units because some can potentially out class high star units if used to their fullest potential. With this in mind I hope if you're just now downloading Fate/GO that you keep this information in mind when you play and to have fun, I know I am.</p>|People here are complaining about how you \u201cneed multiple copies of the same 5 star servant to bring out its max potential\u201d. That\u2019s really a stretch. When you feed another 5 Star servant to your main copy, it levels up their Noble Phantasm and makes it a bit better. But I think you guys are misunderstanding the point of that mechanic. It doesn\u2019t really do that much to warrant you spending money to NP Level 5 that servant. It\u2019s there so that people who accidentally get that servant again in the Gacha don\u2019t feel like they wasted too much of their money for nothing, since there\u2019s no use for multiple copies of a servant aside from feeding it to your original copy and leveling its Noble Phantasm. Also, if you\u2019re getting stuck on Okeanos, you\u2019re just not playing the game correctly. When I was playing the Japanese version, my luck was pretty bad, so I only had one 4 Star from the guaranteed starting roll. (Whoever said they were lucky to get a 4 star servant by rerolling their account is a liar because you\u2019re guarenteed a 4 star servant or higher on your first 10 roll) I heard Okeanos with a team of Siegfried(4Star), Medusa(3Star), Mashu(3Star), and Sasaki Kojiro(1Star). The game isn\u2019t hard. And personally, for me, my waifu/favourite character in the game is Mashu, so I don\u2019t need to spend a dime trying to get her because she\u2019s the starter servant.</p>|I really love this game and the characters! The gameplay is also really good and strategic too and it can even favour 1 Star - 3star Servants as there are plenty of videos where people clear challenge quests with only 1-3 star Servants. This is what makes Fgo really unique compared to other gacha games as even if the servant is not a 5star, it can still work really well and even better than 5stars! So stop complaining about the gacha! There are so many good Servants that are not 4 star or 5 star and they even give out really good welfare 4 stars like Chloe and Rider Kintoki. And you can even borrow your friends 5 star Servants. If you still can\u2019t clear story or hard even maps you can use command spells, but lets be honest, it is all up to the player skill in the end so if you are complaining that the game is too hard and you need better Servants, just get better at the game, it\u2019s that simple. Many \u201chard\u201d stages of the story can be soloed by a single servant (I Euryale who is a 3 star soloed the hardest stage of Gawain and soloed lancetoria with a friend\u2019s Okita. So in summary, get better at the game if you can\u2019t pass it. 1-3 star Servants can carry you a long way. Besides, the average players luck shouldn\u2019t be so abysmal that they can\u2019t get a 4-5 star servant after playing for a while.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 74%;", "one_star": "width: 8%;", "star": "4.4, 5K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#129 in Card"}, {"size": "235.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/gismart/id666830030?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Start to create beats from scratch and become an EDM Star. 32 different pads, +90 sound packs.Beat Maker Go is an ultimate drum pad controller or drum machine app that gives you the opportunity to perform beats and create amazing music tracks on the go.Make awesome beats and music on the fly with Beat Maker Go.

And, I do not see the point of having the in-app purchase when you can download the actual game for free. And, I am in 6th grade I do not have a lot of money on my part because of the fact I do not work. And, I could ask my parents but they would say no. I feel if you are not going to do something change the fact that some people may not know there is an in-app purchase just change it to where people can at least try out the game.  I also saw on the app that it said \u201cUnlimited Access\u201d why MUST someone buy the unlimited access why can they not just play without additional things?

So I know what should be done and how things should work. I have this game 3 stars because it still has simi slow servers and there are tons of small glitches and some pretty big glitches as well. Some small ones are, when you first port somewhere you don\u2019t have a tag and people think your tag less, which is fine just a glitch but a big one I\u2019m noticing with everyone is that sometimes you will have all your troops home yet when you go to send them somewhere, their simply gone. This happened to me while I was out attacking a hive, after about 3 attacks the game did a little lag and suddenly my troops disappeared I couldn\u2019t send them out yet I had all my power. To fix this you have to reset your game, but what if I\u2019m not done attacking and when I reset my game I big guy comes in and zeros me. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars on this game. If that were to happen to me I would be all over. Complaining a storm. Also while your in the chinook if your being attacked your screen isn\u2019t red so you have no idea if your being attacked, you should add that. Thanks for reading and please fix the troop glitch because I\u2019m noticing it more and more. If I changes I\u2019ll make this a 5 star. Cause it\u2019s a really cool game just needs updating in the right places</p>|From the beginning of the game they give you a chance to build up and survive amongst the other players by early on unlocking a piggy bank allowing you to keep resources if you are attacked. Now let me say now at a level 23 command that bank doesn\u2019t do much but in the first few days that helped me keep my drive on building and gathering resources. What pushes me now is my great corps that I\u2019m apart of they help protect me and others on the battlefield and help keep peace and order during the week but on the weekend expect pure chaos. Be prepared to put a shield and wait to the weekend is over to gather resources outside of corps gathering plot or else certain death may come to your troops. With all the things that have changed and happened with this game over the year or so I\u2019ve played it I give it 4 stars it\u2019s fun and frustrating at times but what\u2019s the worst thing that can happen is you lose your army and resources oh and don\u2019t forget the flames you have to look at if you get attacked to but other than that this is a long term fun strategy game I love and recommend to my friends all the time. Occasionally there are bugs but I report it to the devs right away and they usually take care of them in a day or so. I\u2019m happy to play this game all the time and will continue. Have fun gaming</p>|I started this game many months ago and absolutely love the game play for the most part but then you enter the money trap. Quickest way to level up is spending real money. Still not that big a deal so you spend some here and there.....until I discovered many issues along the way....some purchases would be charged and we wouldn\u2019t get what we bought at which point customer support gave many people a \u201cI\u2019m sorry but without a screenshot of the purchase we can\u2019t help you.\u201d So word of advice screenshot everything. The glitches in the game are extensive. From people not getting their purchases to people losing shields in the middle of deep battle after having put a three day shield up among many more things. Then I discovered on a new field you can\u2019t level up or get several basic things without spending money. I\u2019m all for if you want the do things quicker or get a luxury item, pay money but for basic game play it\u2019s ridiculous. So you get sucked in and spend money then when you are finally sick of the money trap, you\u2019ve spent so much money at that point that you feel like you can\u2019t just quit and throw it away. So enter this game with extreme caution. It\u2019s a money trap wrapped in game glitches covered with the worst customer service I\u2019ve ever dealt with in a game.</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 66%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.4, 80.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#109 in Strategy"}, {"size": "117.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/espn/id317469187?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Stream live games, check the latest scores or watch the best highlights with the best brand in sports: ESPN.

Unless there\u2019s a perfect connection watching a game on here is almost possible. Upon attempting to play a game the app will crash about the first 5 times and when it finally does come on you just have to cross your fingers that it won\u2019t crash every 5 minutes. I don\u2019t know how but Fox Sports Go and Yahoo sports work so much better, which is a shame because I like ESPN and their layout. I\u2019ll have to watch MNF on the Yahoo app from now on. It\u2019s just not the games though, trying to navigate thru different sports and news stories is an absolute nightmare. Quite often I\u2019ll click a story and something different will pop up, and on top of that when I click to a specific sports the \u201cheadlines\u201d will 1 or 2 week old news. Haha no idea what\u2019s going on there. I thought ESPN\u2019s new E+ was intriguing, but there\u2019s absolutely no way I pay a monthly fee for something that I find myself getting so frustrated on that I just give up. ESPN please put some TLC into this app.Update: Officially the worst app on the planet. Customer service places you on hold forever and doesn\u2019t address issues and customer service doesn\u2019t respond on Twitter. This app will never get better. ESPN should have to pay users to use the app. Total garbage.Update 2.0: Installed and deleted this app for the hundredth something time because that\u2019s all the troubleshooting they know. I cannot believe I\u2019ve ever paid for ESPN.</p>|I love ESPN and their sports coverage but this app is horrendous. ESPN clearly cares nothing about this app which is odd because they advertise streaming their shows all the time on TV. The App is so slow. When you open the app, you have to wait about 8 seconds for it fully open. Everything you do on the app (scrolling, selecting articles, viewing scores, etc.) there\u2019s about a 3 second delay before the app processes what you did. Even notifications come in about 30 minutes after other sports apps have sent them to me. (DISCLAIMER: the issues are absolutely not my phone. I\u2019m pretty tech savvy and everyone I know has the same issues) Used to be a go to app but now that I have bleacher report and can listen to the podcast on Apple podcast, I never use it. I read some where that espn just links the app to their website so it just try\u2019s to pull things from the website which is why it\u2019s so slow (not sure it is true but I\u2019ve been trying to figure out why it\u2019s so bad and that explanation made sense). I wish they would make a dedicated app. All-in-all, the app is awful. I\u2019m not sure how the app has 4.2 stars. From what I can tell, not many people have reviewed the app since the update that killed it. I wish more people would come do a review because I have yet to meet a person who doesn\u2019t have bad things to say about the app. If they don\u2019t review the app it will never get fixed but oh well.</p>|There are things I do like about this app - it\u2019s easy to follow all your favorite teams, you can watch videos, it updates in real time. But unfortunately the benefits are not outweighed by the annoyances.The biggest (and until today, only) complaint I have is the incessant notifications. I know how to set notifications settings through my phone and the app, it is not an issue of ignorance. I\u2019ve set the strictest settings I could, so I *should* only get a push notification when the two NFL teams I follow score points. Instead, I get constant notifications about random news from the NFL and MLB (the two leagues in which I have tagged favorite teams). I have tried turning of \u201cTeam News\u201d and every other notification setting except the one for points being scored by my NFL teams. Nothing has worked. Eventually I just disabled notifications entirely for that app in the phone\u2019s settings, which almost defeats the point of having it for me.The latest issue is a recurring error message telling me to check my internet connection. Nothing on the app will work, despite me having internet access. The pop up just comes up over and over again as I hit \u201cretry\u201d in vain. I do hope they fix these issues so I can use the app again. Until then, it gets two stars from me.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 75%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.5, 312.4K Ratings", "category": "Sports", "sub_rank": "#4 in Sports"}, {"size": "223.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/jam-city-inc/id290671617?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Over 100 million people are already playing this deliciously sweet match 3 game filled with thousands of fun and challenging levels!Are you tired of matching candy or spreading jelly?

It says my reward is only I don't play away...so the next day I play and it says the same thing, but no reward.  Bogus.  Second, the Facebook app that links the game to my friends who are playing as well keeps glitching and every other day I can only send a reward to ONE friend...who hasn't played in forever.update!  Nov 27,2016I have been playing this game for two years.  Is it fun, yes, is it worth it, mostly.  But lately, since the latest iOS update on iPad, the game crashes perpetually, and especially when I am close to winning...and I've been stuck on the same level for a week because of this.  Tell me, why add cartoon graphics that don't fit the theme of the game, and then not the issues that people are complaining about?  Not playing til I read that these issues of crashing have been fixed.Update October 2017    Pretty addicted to playing this game.  I've come pretty far and all,of the daily rewards and bonus plays within the game are fun.  I just wish we got more lives...the game play goes fast when you are in a hard level...and then you are done til tomorrow when you sign back in....cause I have other games to play.</p>|I really like this game and have played it for a long time. I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars, because every once in a while, the game will set me back a few levels and I have  replay them. When you enter that level, you can see that you have already played it and earned stars. You have to enter that level, then wit that level, and leave the app completely. When you go back in, the game will advance past the level you\u2019ve already played. If the game set you back several levels, you have to go through these steps for each level you\u2019ve already played and earned stars. I did contact support, but my response was that they are sorry that I lost progress and to sign into Facebook and they could fix my progress. I don\u2019t play games through Facebook. Also this has happened numerous times, so I think it needs more than just fixing my progress... I think it may be a bug.</p>|I\u2019ve played this game for years and I\u2019ve been really impressed with the new changes that allow players more opportunities to win coins and boosters without spending actual money. However, the latest update has created a glitch that moves me back a level or two and makes me replay and beat it, even though it shows the number of stars I earned the first time I beat it, and I can\u2019t progress on without replaying and beating the level again. This has happened four times since the update yesterday and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating and it discourages me from playing the game. Why would I keep replaying the same levels after I\u2019ve already beat them? Especially when they weren\u2019t particularly fun levels to begin with...?Also, the game use to add a new set of levels every Tuesday and Thursday. Now, it seems to only be once a week. It doesn\u2019t take a full week to beat twenty levels, so the game just sits unplayed for the majority of the week while I wait for more levels to be added. I wish the developers would go back to adding new levels twice a week.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 79%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 101.1K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#120 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "62.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 9%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/smule/id290596339?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "From Bruno Mars to Mozart, play the hottest songs!Relax your soul with beautiful sounds of piano while playing your favorite tunes on original #1 piano rhythm game.

Okay so last night every single song I have showed 3 stars next to each level of difficulty that I have played at, and just a few minutes ago when I went to open the app, ALL of my songs showed no stars highlighted, no scores, no nothing. Like I just bought them or composed them and haven't even started playing them yet. I am really angry. \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 Also there are just too many ads. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb Every ten seconds after I finish a song, a stupid ad pops up about some coloring book or food game and it's really annoying. \ud83d\ude24Also I really hate how the majority of everyone's favorite songs nowadays can't be played unless you have a VIP membership accessibility. It's ridiculous. I feel that VIP membership to play a song on Magic Piano should be banned, because you know, there are not very many VIP members in the world.I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app from my phone for permanent. I've not only had to deal with the troubles I stated above, but I've also had to deal with the app freezing up, songs I compose that won't let me publish no matter what I do, and Daily Challenge songs taking decades to load and then refreshing the app only for it to crash every time I reopen it. It's getting really frustrating and I can't take it any longer. \ud83d\udeab</p>|I\u2019ve downloaded this app on and off lately, for separate reasons. First of all, I hate all of these ads! I mean, sometimes every time you enter a different song, the same ad pops up. So on top of having to watch these stupid ads for different games, it\u2019s the same one over and over and over. It\u2019s so annoying that I\u2019ve purposely turned off my Wi-Fi just to get rid of ads. It\u2019s ridiculous!      Second of all, I hate that the achievements give you only one or two coins! I mean, about eighty percent of the songs cost twenty five coins! And you work so hard on a single achievement to only get one coin? It\u2019s stupid!       Last but not least, there\u2019s the case of this VIP stuff! I mean, half the songs in the entire app is in the VIP section! And almost all of my favorite songs are in the VIP section! It\u2019s just not fair. Why should we spend our money on some stupid things like VIP memberships when eventually we\u2019re gonna delete the game for all these reasons! Basically what this game- and all games in fact- is saying is that instead of using money to buy exciting things, we\u2019re using it for an online item that isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s stupid, and it\u2019s a waste of money. Even though I somewhat enjoyed the game, all of these things are making my interests go down! Fix these things!</p>|I used to have this app as a very young child, and the only reason why I deleted it was because I got frustrated at its difficulty. Just recently, the game crossed my mind and I decided to re-download it and give it another go. Because I\u2019ve gotten a lot better at video games over the years, the difficulty of the game was no longer a problem. There, were, however, new problems with the game that I didn\u2019t expect to encounter.      For starters, the game has WAY to many ads. I can\u2019t play a single song, not even a short one like Happy Birthday, without being forced to watch a stupid, boring video that I don\u2019t care about. I got this game because I remembered how fun it was, but it\u2019s kind of hard to have fun when 90% of the game is just you watching ads for other games.      Second of all, this game is basically begging you for money at this point. The fact that some of the songs are only available to VIP users is just stupid. Do they really expect us to spend actual money on a stupid piano game that we have on our phones? Besides from that, every achievement you can accomplish in the game (leveling up, getting new songs, etc.) can be bought with just a few bucks. The fact that literally everything in this game has been put up for sale is terrible.        Well, that\u2019s my review</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 50%;", "one_star": "width: 20%;", "star": "3.6, 14.1K Ratings", "category": "Music", "sub_rank": "#13 in Music"}, {"size": "381.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/seriously/id868013621?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Join over 80,000,000 people who are already playing this top-rated FREE puzzle adventure!

And so then I instantly installed the game !! It's very addictive because at first it's easy and then they present to you how the slugs have come here to attack. It is also very addictive because of how you can update your little critters ( i dont know what they are) and many effects they can do, and so much more! :D But it should ONLY be for 10+ years old because I wouldn't recommend you to play this gamw if you get mad easily or you get too frustrated to play the game anymore because the number of losses you have had :| Yes, you will have a number of losses. Yes, the game will get harder and harder at a point you just want to give up \ud83d\ude32! So don't play the game if you have trouble on it yourself and/or you get mad/frustrated easily with it. I do recommend the game to the people who are older than 10+ years, I myself am 12 years old and every time I don't defeat the Slug I get mad but I don't have temper tantrums. It's an addictive game from the starting point, throughout the whole thing\ud83d\ude0b! So play it because I mean it's better than Candy Crush where it's all so simple :-(! Totally recommend to those who think are attractive to it though :D!</p>|The anti-candy crush ad got me here, The game kept me here. I AMOST want to CARRY ON AND Complain about the gold bars.... lower the price or give me more moves... that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t even care that I feel sometimes I need TO USE  them to pass a board. Mostly because I spent that time on candy crush and I\u2019d rather move on! The ONLY reason I WONT complain is because the game simply gives you way to much (that better NOT CHANGE... EVER). The prizes literally never END, and you actually need them to achieve your goals. Of course you need more of one that the other, but in any game you will. There are mini games that ALSO GIVE YOU PRIZES at certain levels and the main game gives them as well.... this doesn\u2019t include the prizes for winning... there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with this game! I\u2019ve learned that you can\u2019t trust the his team as you go on OR not, hints aren\u2019t as predictable as candy crush. The most important thing I love is, as a New Yorker and commuting on the subway, you don\u2019t need to be connected online. Unlike King games, this is important (this had better NOT CHANGE... EVER).... one other minor improvement, I\u2019d suggest, is better direction on how to use the fiends without having to figure it out AND why you give the option to switch without knowing what\u2019s needed on the board. Other than that... I recommend this game!

You'll also be building your own bases, forming guilds to help work with other players, and just trying to be the biggest, baddest, dragon-taming emperor of them all.\u201d-Touch ArcadePlease note that War Dragons is free to play, but you are able to purchase game items with real money.

I\u2019ve been playing for about 5 months now and I absolutely love the team I\u2019m on. Took me a few team changes to get to where I wanted to be but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m where I am.This is a competitive game and can be very time consuming but also can work around a busy schedule if you care enough to work with it. You don\u2019t have to spend money unless you want to but I will say it helps to have an Elite account, especially if you want to really progress in the game. If I had anything else to say, it wouldn\u2019t be particularly criticism, but a piece of advice/inspiration for the creators. It would be simply this: many that play for long periods of time work really hard to progress in the game and once they get somewhere successful, often times the smallest thing holds them back from helping their team really win in the end. I would love it, and I know many others would too, if the creators made a chest that could be won by achieving some goal once a month that would give a healthy dose of Sigil, Rubies, Egg Tokens, 12 hour speed ups and maybe even some lumber and food. Rubies are hard to get unless yourself or teammates buy packages often. Sigil only comes around when you really spend a ton of time in events. So if a prize like that could be won and earned, available to anyone without purchasing anything, that would be so awesome. But besides all that, this game is addictive and fun! 5 Stars!</p>|I am addicted to this game! I have quit this game before due to lack of time and I\u2019m embarrassed to say, rage, but I am sure to never have those feelings again. Whenever I have spare time I get up and set everything and gather all my supplies and then when I have another block of free space I do the same thing all over again. All the people who play are very caring and kind, I do have a few requests though. First of all, I don\u2019t understand why the transactions between two players have to take twenty minutes, now I know I might seem a little dramatic, but I know that if I need supplies badly enough to ask people, I wouldn\u2019t want to wait to get them. Next, I don\u2019t like how hard it is to get dragon eggs, with egg tokens being limited to what you can do or recover, I feel that some of the eggs take a bit more than they should. All of these things or minor requests and I don\u2019t feel the need to make a bigger deal out of this than I already have. I think this game is wonderful, and even if everything isn\u2019t perfect, that\u2019s ok because I know how hard people work to make games like these, so feel free to overlook my requests, because I am not expecting anything to change, I just thought I would make my requests clear to see if anyone agreed with my ideas and/or concerns. Thank you for taking the time to ready this, and have a good day/night.</p>|I love this game. It never strikes me boring or unsatisfying, like games I usually play. I never get bored, because it\u2019s always a new thing to do or accomplish. It\u2019s also so satisfying and when you get a hard earned dragon or finally upgrade that storage vault; So nice! I especially love it when we win team wars or go to the next team ranking, but there\u2019s one problem I\u2019d love to fix. Why does it cost money to do so much??? If you could finish the game without paying the money for it, then people might start respecting that and start playing more, or buying packs to make it exciting. It\u2019s hard to stay satisfied when this happens, and what about people who don\u2019t have access to money, like children who have parents who won\u2019t pay for the game? I say people should definitely get this game, but you should also fix this problem, especially in ember. I loved it when I dominated a base three levels higher then me easily in one go with ember, but now I\u2019m at the point where ember is starting to not be powerful, because I don\u2019t spend money on games and can\u2019t level him up. I feel like my efforts were wasted and I almost quit. So war dragons team, if you read this, please fix this problem! Thanks for the time and effort.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 74%;", "one_star": "width: 8%;", "star": "4.4, 16K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#93 in Strategy"}]
