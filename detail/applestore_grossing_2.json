They are a little narrow in their offerings from any individual band.  For example, if choose a \u201cstation\u201d called Supertramp I heat Supertramp\u2019s greatest hits over and over again, which is fine, but if I choose a station based on a specific band, it is safe to assume I like more than just their most popular songs.  I should hear their entire catalog.  If I choose a genre-based station it is okay to play just hits from various bands in that genre, but if I pick a specific band, Pandora should be smart enough to realize I want everything from that band, not just their hit songs.I also have a frequent connectivity issue.  I live in a rural area where it is not uncommon to lose cellular coverage and subsequently my Pandora feed.  No problem, I understand this is unavoidable.  The problem is that when I regain cellular connectivity Pandora often will not reboot. About half the time I have to turn my phone completely off to get Pandora to restart.  This is not safe when I am driving so I either have to pull over or live without Pandora until I get to my destination.  I have an iPhone 6s with Apple CarPlay in my vehicle.I love Pandora except for these two issues.  Thanks,Mike Kingsley</p>|I listen to Ryan Farish radio on Pandora Plus everyday. So relaxing. It has become an addiction. I connect it to my car audio via Bluetooth on the iPhone app and play it on Roku TV while reading, surfing the net and relaxing. I listen to Pandora more than I watch TV. It has a great selection of new age/trance instrumental artists like Ryan Farish (of course), 7 and 5, and Deosil. It throws in some classical, soft jazz, and EDM for variety. Even my bunny likes it! I tried Premium but went back down to Plus. I don\u2019t skip much because it plays most of the music I like that has a thumbs up. I also just like to listen to the music randomly. Most of the songs and artists I like most, could not be replayed or added to playlist on Premium anyways due to licensing. Which is ridiculous considering you\u2019re paying the extra money that should cover this. Another downside is the replay/back button won\u2019t work in the car. I can skip forward using the car\u2019s track button on the steering wheel, but back to replay the song won\u2019t work, especially if the song cannot be replayed because of licensing. I also found the Premium app too confusing. Other than that, love this music. Could listen to it forever.</p>|Constantly goes offline when I have plenty of service. Now it won\u2019t play the songs on my playlists. I select a song and it chooses a random song from the same playlist. I have premium yet your licensing restrictions require that a lot of the songs I like require to be listened to on the radio part of the app. What\u2019s the point of paying for premium? I\u2019d rather deal with ads. I listen to this app while I\u2019m driving and now with our distracted driving laws in my state this app makes it IMPOSSIBLE for me to get it working if it starts wigging out on me. The offline playlists literally play crap music and only play like four songs. When you go back into service it chooses a playlist for you instead of resuming what you had going in the first place. This app is a total waste of money for premium and a total waste of time and effort for commuters without premium. Like if I want to listen to a song over, sure I will listen to an ad but don\u2019t prompt me 7 times about premium before letting me rewind like seriously how am I supposed to listen and drive when the app is asking you 20 freaking questions. Stop making things more of an effort than they need to be. The other day I selected a song and it started randomly playing other songs on that playlist but then immediately choosing another and another and so on. My songs were on a literal shuffle.

Not with the programming or anything but the algorithms used to calculate the direction of the rockets. As you get further into the game you start to get fewer and fewer moves to the point where you need to be extremely lucky or buy stuff. It consistently asks if you want to buy coins I don't really mind that that much but if you don't like that then this game isn't for you. Now about the rockets, you combine five or more blocks of a certain color you get a rocket is says \"random\" but I have been counting the rockets and put together a graph real quick of the rockets. Depending on the level and the nature of the objective you may desperately need a vertical rocket but nine out of ten of them are going to be horizontal if you need a horizontal you get a vertical. If your down to your last few moves and you have the opportunity to get a rocket and win the level if it is a certain direction, 14 out of 15 times it's going to be the opposite direction. I found that the math in the app used to determine direction purposely gives you the opposite direction to push you into buying more coins, which can become extremely frustrating when you reach higher levels and it takes you three or four days to beat one level. Other then this if you looking for a casual gaming experience this game isn't bad (I downloaded to play at work when times are slow). This game isn't bad though</p>|I sit and play this game nearly everyday all day long\ud83d\ude02. I hate when I\u2019m out of lives! I was reading some of the reviews; I too feel that the direction of the arrows make it impossible for the game to be beaten at times. Like others, I shopped the bundles to complete levels, only to lose my coins/ lives w/only 1 move lft \ud83d\ude14.                                                                                Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t start playing the game when there was unlimited lives. However, at the next upgrade, it would be a good idea to have more than 5 lives Another way game players my be satisfied is when a player is w/I the top 1-5; maybe give those top players an unlimited play time span. Although There\u2019s no way everyone can be satisfied, but that\u2019s a start! I knw I\u2019d be satisfied with a change like that.                                                 This game is soooooo good that when I\u2019m out of lives I\u2019ve look at other Peak games as well as similar game like Toy Blast until my lives are restore. No luck though, they are all to kiddish.  If simple changes are made to accommodate \u201ca few\u201d of the players wishes, I would GLADLY change my rating to five stars. Overall, this is my FAVORITE GAME\u2763\ufe0f</p>|I am getting tired of games that have in game purchases for limited use items, then adjust the \u201crandomness\u201d to minimize useful moves as players progress through the game. This game represents a trend that only allows reasonable progress by purchasing \u201cuseful\u201d aids to complete a level. I have surveyed several pay as you play games and find that, in general, the MO of these games is consistent, start simple and make winning higher levels nearly impossible without purchasing additional aids. It\u2019s time for consumers to boycott games that rely on this mechanism to generate income, as it leads to a no-win situation. I would rather pay for a well crafted game that allows the player to use their skill rather than download a \u201cfree\u201d game that stacks the odds against the player as a means of generating income. Really, it\u2019s time to send a message to the vendors of these type of income generating games by boycotting their products.Finally, I resent the use of advertising that misrepresents the nature of a game by showing levels that do not exist in their downloaded app. In my mind that is a type of bait and switch that has been declared illegal for other consumer goods. I do believe that it is time for the bait and switch laws to be applied to software just as it is for other consumer products.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.7, 470.2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#54 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "217.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/playrix-games/id1162116447?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Welcome to Homescapes!

And the options they let you choose from are neat. Now I want to see the whole house become beautiful and upgraded. Of course, since I never play these games I am really bad at beating levels, I think I\u2019ve been playing for 4 days and I\u2019m only on level 30ish. But I\u2019ve already redecorated the bedroom and the living room and it looks totally different from when I started!Now a couple things I don\u2019t particularly like.I don\u2019t know if this changes with progression, but only having 5 hearts to beat levels and then waiting 30 minutes for them to come back is a bit of a let down, especially since I\u2019m really bad at beating levels. And when I get a gift of having unlimited hearts for 30 minutes, sometimes I\u2019m not somewhere where I can take advantage of that! Like if I was playing at work on a short break and I get that, I have no control over it so I usually miss out. So if they gave it to you as a \u201cuse when you want to\u201d kind of gift that would be most beneficial.Overall though the game is really fun! Hope you liked reading my novel!</p>|Like other players, I really enjoy the game. However, there is a huge disparity between the coins and stars you win and the coins and stars you have to spend. For example, stars are used to complete tasks. BUT, you only get ONE star per level you beat and tasks like fixing a fountain can cost up to a DOZEN stars to complete, so it takes forever to move forward in the game. And some of the tasks are just stupid. Calling someone is 1 star, having them come look at the problem is another, then fixing the issue can be 6 more, but then something goes wrong and you have to complete another task before you can finish the first one! As far as coins go, you win 50 per regular level and 100 per hard level you beat, with each leftover move, bomb, rocket and airplane giving you one to two extra coins. Now, if you need one or two extra moves to win a level, it will cost you 900 coins for five moves. That\u2019s 180 coins per move. If you win in two moves, you\u2019ll get 3-6 coins back on the unused moves that you just paid 540 coins for. You can\u2019t get much more unfair than that! They also have lots of  \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d levels that you\u2019ll either have to play until you just want to delete the game altogether, you\u2019ll eventually have things hit just perfectly so you win or you give up and spend real cash on coin packs. Playrix has great games but they need to get more player friendly and less money hungry or they\u2019ll go the way of YoVille and lots of other great game developers.</p>|I really enjoy playing this game. It has a lot of fun aspects to it. There are just a few reasons I didn\u2019t give it five stars. First, it frequently feels like using power ups is a waste. Whenever I choose to use one, it almost always seems like they have set the game up against me. I usually play a level several times before deciding to use a power up, and it seems like more often than not, when I do use a power up, they choose to place the power up on the game board in some of the most inconvenient, useless spots. Second, combo moves don\u2019t work like I think they should. Whenever I set up a move that has a chain reaction of multiple moves, the moves don\u2019t effect obstacles next to them more than once. For example, if I have a chain reaction of even just two that are created against a box that takes more than one move to remove, only the first move effects the box, rather than both of them. (That is kind of hard to explain without showing an example...). Third, the rewards you get for playing each day reset every seven days instead of just accumulating and getting better. Fourth, it costs way too many coins for things (adding extra moves at the end of a level, power ups, etc.) in comparison to how many they give you for completing levels. It really is a fun game, and I definitely don\u2019t expect every level to be easy to win, those are just a few of the complaints I have.</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 70%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.5, 315.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#7 in Simulation"}, {"size": "96.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/big-fish-games-inc/id292594310?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Download Big Fish Casino now!

You can play while chatting with people.  that\u2019s why people play this game for years.  Because you make friends.  They make is hard to win and do well.  They sell chips for super expensive.  Actual money.  So why you might ask, when you\u2019re not considered \u201crich\u201d on this game unless you have over 100 million chips do they sell chips for insane amounts of money?  The answer is because people buy them.  People spend incredible amounts of money on this game for chips with no actual real world value. A person could easily spend $100 in chips and lose it in a minute.  But people are addicted to playing and buying chips.  And so the creators of this game make that their main focus.  Getting people to spend chunks of their retirement savings, kids college savings, grocery money, etc on fake chips with absolutely no value.  There\u2019s even other parts of the game which people mainly use to socialize, such as poker and blackjack. So they don\u2019t even bother updating those games.  Because they make money off of people\u2019s addictions to slots.  It\u2019s remarkable, insane and ridiculous.</p>|So I have spent too much on chips. As far as I\u2019m concerned , any amount of money you pay towards extras in an app is \u201ctoo much \u201c. Here\u2019s the issue with this particular app. When you spend your own money , you might hit a couple of small minis or jackpots , but then you will depleted. After all, your account use now become \u201cflagged ..tagged, etc\u201d and you will not win just due to the simple fact you\u2019ve spent money and they want you to again and , again and of of course , repeatedly. Today I\u2019ve not been able to play as many of my friends have stated the same problem, which is when you open the BF app, it stays purely blank with only sound, and then it just shuts down ! I\u2019ve contacted them through there so called \u201cGame Help\u201d app only to have them completely ignore me. This is such a waste of fun and time! I\u2019ve had people stalk me, when I reported them for disgusting pics , as well as acting like it\u2019s some dating app. I\u2019ve chosen to not use messenger through them , yet I\u2019ve gotten naked pics and disgusting messages. I honestly thought this would be a fun escape .. uhm NO! You cannot win , and if you do win ; it\u2019s because they want you to spend money. The newest owner was supposed to care of the free sites where you use a generator and can download millions for free. I\u2019ve had over 30 +people try , and about 3 succeed. So , BF, I ask as a loyal app user , change your greedy ways !!!</p>|Do not get yourself suckered into this app or their other App Jackpot Magic Slots.  They are the most money hungry, greedy company I have ever experienced.  All their updates are made to increase you chance at losing chips so you will buy more.  The club feature is full of BF admins in the top teams so you will never get there but you will buy buy buy trying. The rich get richer (because they work there) and the poor just keep buying. I have been on this app for 4.5 years and their customer service gets worse every day. They don\u2019t care about anything but your money.  Find an app that you can really play for free on.  I will be deleting this app for good. They started a new VIP reward program and sent me a message saying I was automatically enrolled.  I was to get 117 mil chips from this new program. My balance was 64 mil.  When I sent in a ticket they said oh sorry we made a mistake. Now granted I didn\u2019t ask to be enrolled in this program and I can not decide I don\u2019t want to do it.  It\u2019s made to only allow you one boost per week so you lose your chips in the first day and buy the next 6 days.  Before this we could ask for a boost about every 2-3 days.  Well I have decided this app is no longer fun and won\u2019t be playing anymore. As I said don\u2019t let them sucker you into their whirlpool of money sucking games.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 76%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 146.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#58 in Casino"}, {"size": "307.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/glu-games-inc/id284419051?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Team up to build your roster and dominate the league in Tap Sports Baseball 2018  New Ways to Compete \u2022 Team up with a club for your chance to beat the best of the best  \u2022 Create-A-Player lets YOU dominate the league \u2022 Test your MLB predictions in Pick\u2019em to get extra rewards \u2022 Fan favorite Walk Off Hero is back and better than ever Manage Your Team, Compete to Win \u2022 Play with official MLB Teams and MLBPA Players \u2022 Build and level up your MLB roster to climb up the leaderboards   \u2022 Compete for the greatest baseball legends in daily events and challenges\u2022 Swing for the fences in Home Run Battles mode and go for glory in Walk Off Hero mode Play with Friends, Join Clubs, and Tournaments  \u2022 Tap to swing with easy one-touch control, anytime and anywhere  \u2022 Compete against multiple friends in action-packed gameplay sessions\u2022 Play in weekly events and prove who possesses the ultimate team in head-to-head competitions \u2022 Join a Club or create your own to compete in exclusive events for top prizes Major League Baseball trademarks and copyrights are used with permission of MLB Advanced Media, L.P.

The graphics are super unnatural and half the time you are up to bat, you get out and if you do get a hit, it is a sloppy single. I have no idea why the \u201cnew and improved 2018 version\u201d became 10 times crappier than the version 3 years ago. When the pitcher throws a curveball, it has unnatural movements and I think it\u2019s gonna be right down the middle but then it teleports a foot away and I end up swinging at air. When you finally get a hit to left field and it\u2019s about to go over the warning track, the outfielder teleports right where the ball lands. Even when you you hit it over their head, one of them has to make an unbelievably diving catch like he\u2019s some mickey mantle or something. I spent over $3,000 on the 2017 version and when I get the 2018 version, and I log into my account, i am back to square one. I have 0 gold bars and 0 dollars. And even though it says in the reviews on this crap game is 90% five stars, it usually means that this \u201cplayer\u201d is another robot working for GLU. It doesn\u2019t matter what your stats are for your team, if your guy up has an overall rating of 97, and the pitcher has an overall rating is 11, the robot just has to throw three unnatural curveballs and I find myself about to smash my phone is a million pieces. I can\u2019t tell the difference between the 2017 and 2018 version. GLU is literally draining my bank account. I don\u2019t get GLU\u2019s trick: how are you not sued or in jail by now? I\u2019m deleting this waste of storage.</p>|TLDR: Avoid the game, they are an unjust company who bans people without warning and with no explanation. Simply being too good at the game can lead to a ban which is just stupid. Normally I do not write reviews or leave a rating. This time however, I feel like I really need to for my friend. He spent a lot of free time playing this game because he thoroughly enjoyed the game. It got to the point where his team was so strong and he had played so much that he could put up great scores without any exploits or cheating. He was just that good at the game. Then one day, Glu decided that he was exploiting something and banned him from participating in events. They don\u2019t say anything specific, just that his account was reviewed to be exploiting something in the game and that he was permanently banned from events. No warning, no chance for appeal, no clear explanation. I bet if we weren\u2019t f2p they would be more willing to help my friend, but since we aren\u2019t they don\u2019t care. It just feels so unfair for my friend who actually enjoyed this game to have it taken away because they are suspicious and believe there is no way he can do the things he does in the game. Utterly ridiculous and completely unfair. He does nothing wrong, just plays the game instead of autoplaying everything and then gets banned. Stay away from this game, it is not worth your time when you could get banned for being too good at the game.</p>|I never write reviews on apps but I\u2019m only writing this because I think it\u2019s absolutely necessary and I hope GLU fixes this in the future. I know this game gets a lot of hate for having bad gameplay, however, I don\u2019t actually mind the gameplay. I\u2019ve been playing tap sports baseball since it was first released and I know in app purchases have always been popular. Honestly, the option to pay to improve your team is a good option for both the user and the company but GLU has taken it way to far with this game. The fun part of this game is trying to be competitive and earning good rewards to improve your team but this is no longer possible unless you spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this game. Read that sentence again and listen to how ridiculous that sounds. The crazy thing is that GLU has found a way to get a lot of people to actually spend this kind of money. The introduction of bonus points ruined this game and made it a complete and total money grab. This game is not fun unless you spend tons of money and no one really wants to do that. The amount of players that has quit this game for this reason is outrageous and GLU I\u2019m begging that in your next game you just tone it down a little. For all of our sakes, just put out a good game and you will make money stop designing the game to make those who pay the most win easily.

For example, they give new players \u201clucky\u201d river cards to win n such. I noticed around lvls 30, 50, n 80 that my \u201cbeginners luck\u201d was adjusted down a lil each time. N finally at around lvl 130 it must have been turned completely off. I went thru over 300million chips in almost 2weeks of play where I literally lost all but 15 hands played. It was then that I stopped playing for quite awhile.I started playing again to play with my friends. At this point I\u2019ve played well over 40k+ hands now. Another irritating example of algorithm manipulation has been is how I\u2019ll pay the blinds and play the hand only to lose, over n over again, hand after hand. Then wen u fold on crap cards (pre-flop), u suddenly realize u folded a winning hand. U would have won either thru making a low pair or by getting the 4 precise cards u would\u2019ve needed. With a ratio of 100 (played n lost) to 3 (folded n would\u2019ve won), if horribly obvious that things r being manipulated to encourage u to purchase chips. But, even with these flaws, I would recommend this poker app because, all the other apps I\u2019ve tried \u201ccheat\u201d u out of ur chips way more bluntly n don\u2019t seem as secure against hackers as WSOP. Also, they do give u plenty of ways to get free chips.</p>|This is the best poker game out there and it is near perfect I just have a few things that I think could make this truly great.  First, I would like some type of free roll tournament every week or month where people could enter for free and maybe earn some bit of real money.  Second, I think it would also be nice if there was just a little bit more time to make a decision with hands unless I have missed something.  Finally, it would be cool to have leagues of some sort both public and private where people could play like a season or something along those lines. Now to hit on a point that a lot of people bring up in their reviews about having to pay money.  Depends on how good you are in all honesty and how well you understand poker and how the people who make games make money.  If you aren\u2019t good and you want the games bracelets/rings you are either going to have to be good and earn them the real way or pay lots of money.  Poker is a game where 80% or more of people that play never turn a profit it would be stupid not to capitalize on this as a developer and they also have to make money to give us a great game.  Like I said truly a great game just a lot of people not understanding how things work in their reviews.</p>|Great overall game play. App works with the only glitch I could tell is for some reason after two or three games if I lost it would gray out and I would have to force close the app to get functionality back.  Weird but not major.   Now...I do not believe the card play is random by any stretch of the imagination. We all have bad luck streaks. Not complaining about that but the creative ways you can lose is ridiculous.  The number of games you can lose in a row is crazy. At one point I lost 25 or so games in a row.  Again, could be bad luck.  But then you look at it overall and there does seem to be a pattern. One of which is you go on long losing streaks where you never or barely win.  Then the next thing you know you\u2019re winning 2 of three games for days.   Okay, let\u2019s chalk that up to luck. How about when during play when someone gets down to their lay chips/hand, the number of times they win is staggering. It\u2019s gotta be 90% or higher wins for them, me included.  My strategy ended up being (1) never bet when there was someone on their last legs betting, they were gonna win and (2) if I was on my last legs I knew I was gonna win regardless of what I had.  Again, worked about 90% of the time in my estimation.  Got tired of the swings and last stand winners so I deleted.  Not a sore loser. Had worked my way up to $17m by playing $300k games to win $1.5m.  Even through streaks was able to maintain a decent amount of chips.</p>", "four_star": "width: 19%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 67%;", "one_star": "width: 7%;", "star": "4.4, 85.5K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#6 in Casino"}, {"size": "219.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/playtika-uk-house-of-fun-limited/id580824260?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "**Grab 100 FREE SPINS and experience House of Fun**It\u2019s the hottest collection of free slot games of 2018!

Got to be a big baller for a bit before I gave and you took it all back which was fun and exciting.  Have a couple hundred thousand left and I\u2019m hoping I can win some back before I go broke completely so I can continue to play.Thank you for the wins and the opportunity to be a Millionaire for at least a few days.  \ud83d\ude0aI love this game but my biggest problem with it is that it\u2019s super hard to win a big amount of chips.,  and when you are lucky enough to win a couple hundred thou. Or even a million you almost need to quit playing altogether to keep it because they take it right back and they don\u2019t just take a  little they take it all.  It\u2019s to the point where it\u2019s becoming like the other slot games that  I\u2019ve deleted because it became a point of win a little and then lose lose lose to win a little then play and lose lose lose to buy buy buy buy and then straight out to just being robbed.  I would love to win a decent sized amount and be able to continue to play the other games without going broke game wise as well as pocket wise in one sitting.</p>|Even though I have had a few complaints thru the years, it is the most fun of all the slot games I have tried.  I love the game it seems the more coins I purchase the less I get to play. It had been that when i bought coins I was able to play a little while. Also, beware when the game you are playing resets it jacks back up to maximum play, so if you aren't paying attention, you lose it all...I just lost $1,750,000.....a phone call interrupted my play and when I went back to it, it reset from my normal play of $5,000. They should reset on the minimum and let go up as high as we want! Ridiculous, but, that's another way they get you. Lately I'm not getting my daily free coins, sometimes just one day, and others times 2 in a row. I have tried to contact for help, but it was just keepsake  loading and won't go through. It is so aggravating to purchase coins and just watch them slip right by without a hit at all..  Games are fun and I'm sure a lot of work goes into this site. I do wish we could get more free coins. I have been playing for years and have only reached $28,900 coins every three hours. So, I do purchase occasionally. Sometimes it allows me at lot of play and sometimes not.</p>|This game constantly changes your bidding amount to a higher amount and takes most of your money away before you even realize it. You contact customer service and they tell you that your problem that you have to keep an eye on it. No other games out there change the bidding Amounts. Then you deal with customer service and they practically call you a liar and as you notice all they keep throwing out there and is specials to buy specials. Looks like this game is only interested in your money not customer service and eventually they will lose all their customers because you\u2019ve got to be honest and real to be successful. Love the game hate the customer service and hate the greed for money. Anyone else having the same issue. I purchased a lot of money there to play and not complain if I lose but when they take it away illegally And change your bed and say I am one is supposed to keep an eye on the bet when I have change nothing but do my same bet.  I would like this company to be investigated to see how many others are going through the same problem and how they have to learn customer service is number one.

You win some. You lose some. I downloaded this app awhile back and was instantly hooked on it. I\u2019m addicted. It\u2019s the best slots app I\u2019ve come across. I spend real money on it every few weeks or so and do fine. You just can\u2019t bet a million chips and expect to hit the jackpot soon as you bet. It\u2019s just like if you were in a casino. Luck is not on everyone\u2019s side and if you bet recklessly then you are gonna lose all your chips. Bet smart and play smart. It does have glitches here and there but tell me an app that doesn\u2019t. All electronic devices have some type of glitch. The glitch I\u2019ve noticed is when the slots are spinning and you get your balloon it will change the squares on the slot board. You aren\u2019t losing out though. You still get your reward. The only thing I would suggest is that they move the bet amount button away from the spin button due to the fact that you can sometimes tap it and if it\u2019s on max bet well you just bet a bunch of chips by accident. So if they would change that it would be great. Other than that it\u2019s a wonderful game and I\u2019ll continue playing it daily.</p>|Worst game ever!!! Do NOT spend any money as it will take all your chips so fast your head will spin!!! Collect for days &amp; weeks every 2 hours to build up a billion chips &amp; loose them all in a matter of an hour!!! This game is so rigged for them to when all your chips if you buy them just to try &amp; get you to spend more!  If your dumb enough to spend your money then I guess you deserve to loose it. I have been playing for months now &amp; wasted so. I have spent so much time trying to collect two hour bonuses &amp; daily bonuses all to loose it in that short period every time! Wish I would of not wasted my time at all!!! WHAT A JOKE!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!! I\u2019m sure if you spent a little money at first they would probably let you win a little to make you think it\u2019s legit but in the end they just want your money! Also I\u2019m at level 111 &amp; have absolutely no points earned to redeem so how the hell are you suppose to even get stuff when they don\u2019t even let you earn points like it says you will for playing. This is the same app maker that also does My Vegas slots &amp; it\u2019s the same thing. I have played it at the same time &amp; yet still no rewards points not a single one to use to get stuff with! VERY ANGRY &amp; deleting both! I hope Apple bans them from the store as they are totally ripping people off that spend actual money. They have ripped me off of my time &amp; time is money to me. Deleting both apps I\u2019m through period!!</p>|The game is a lot of fun. Great graphics. Great casino experience. I played for a year or so with just the free chips you get every hour and daily. Recently I started to purchase chips to build up my LPs and just because I enjoy the game. Once I did that the winning stopped. The more I bet on spins the less I win. I always wondered why free spins was never based on my bet amount. Sometimes they were more. Sometimes much less. I read the q &amp; a on their support page and it said the free spins bonus is based on your average bet from the time of your last free spin game. That is not true at all. I tested it numerous times today. Betting $2Mil per spin I got the bonus round 3 times. Each time my wins during the free spins were based on a bet of $500,000 or less each time. What I find to be true is it is based on how many coins you purchase to play. Once you spend money they want you to spend more so they don\u2019t let the chips last long.

My therapist recommended I try mindfulness, but I didn\u2019t take her very seriously at first. Then I read a magazine article that recommended Calm and I decided to tried it. I am so thankful that I did. I have learned so much. This app has taught me to take a step back from my anxious thoughts and really examine them. It has also helped in situations where I was on the verge of panic. I have been able to pause, remind myself to breathe, and then I find it much easier to cope. The new Master Class series is fascinating. I have been using what I learned to recognize all sorts of habits I didn\u2019t even realize were negative habits, like mindless social media, saying up late, procrastination, etc. I\u2019ve been applying the lessons from that series and asking myself, \u201cwhat am I really getting from this behavior?\u201d Most times, that\u2019s enough just to disenchant myself from the behavior and move on to a more positive experience. Thank you, Calm team, genuinely. This app has been an essential tool in helping pull me out of the darkness of postpartum anxiety, helping me fight daily my anxious tendencies, and has helped me be a better spouse, parent, and person. Keep up the awesome work!</p>|Need help with a guided meditation to help clear and calm your mind? I use CALM daily in my mindful journey. I\u2019ve developed techniques that help me combat a busy and destructive mind and I continuing to learn how to balance my thoughts. I\u2019m learning how to harness my own energy to create a balance and flow. Meditation isn\u2019t about shutting down the mind or silencing thoughts. Meditation isn\u2019t even about saying \u201cI can\u2019t do it because I can\u2019t sit still and I\u2019m always thinking of something\u201d. Our minds are naturally busy so are the thoughts that come in and out. Meditation helps me to non judgmentally acknowledge those thoughts then release them so they are not the forefront of my existence. We can\u2019t properly unpack each thought to deal with them accordingly with clarity and focus if our entire system is overloaded. My quest for peace, balance, clarity, focus and being present continues, and CALM is part of that journey. \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \ud83d\udd49 to enhance your experience, you can customize sounds that will help you create the right ambience. This feature is important to me because I am in a busy city so you can hear everything all the time. Also, their free services offer a vast variety of techniques so don\u2019t be discouraged by the price. There are plenty of great free option in the app.</p>|This app is a life saver... I\u2019m on two different medications for my anxiety, depression, PTSD and more. There are days where I\u2019m completely happy with the effects of my medications and then there are days where I feel like I\u2019ve back peddled and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Calm is the best app for my worst of days. I use their \u201cbreath\u201d function weekly- and their nature sounds every single night all night long. it helps me go to sleep because sleep is a huge problem for me. The best part is you can lock your phone and it\u2019ll keep going! The free meditations are amazing and the best part is that they remain free... it doesn\u2019t automatically go away after trial. You do have other options to buy more- but you don\u2019t have too. You can benefit from the free version which really leads me to believe that the makers of this app are really in this to help people like me. I will eventually buy the full version- but right now it\u2019s not in budget. This app is a staple for me and my mental health. It\u2019s a huge part of my healing process and my calming down processes after anxiety attacks that happen almost daily.

However there have been some bugs that aren\u2019t major but are a little annoying. One bug is where you are walking but every once in a while you look in a random direction if you look in a different direction while moving. Also bed spawns don\u2019t work well underground. I don\u2019t know if it is supposed to be like that but it would be nice if that was changed. I also have a problem with picking the original seeds. When I go to pick one in settings there is nothing there and it won\u2019t let me type in the seed. Thank you for reading this and if you don\u2019t have the game then get it nowThis is a new part I am adding on to my earlier review. Thank you for trying to make the game better with updates but there is too much you are adding on. The textures should not have been messed with (accept glass ;)) because it ruined the classic feeling of the game. Also the cross bow should be easier to use because you have to click after you pull back the arrow and click again to release it. But I guess the easy aim makes up for it. I do like the water features but there is no use for turtles because all they have dropped is different sea plants. The treasure maps are reeeeealy cool though. You can find good loot but some things are not usable (heart of the sea). It could be that I don\u2019t know how to use it but there should be an easier way to look at how you use it.</p>|I love Minecraft, it is a great multiplayer game and I think it has really come a long way since the beginning. I have been playing Minecraft since the release of the first game, and it has just gotten better and better. But this game could use some improvements especially for mobile users. I feel like the computer users of Minecraft get updates quicker. For instance I have seen people on computers that have the full aquatic update , while I\u2019m on an iPad and I am only now getting news of this update plus it is coming so slowly. Another problem I have with this game is the in-app purchases I mean I know they have added coins but you still have to buy those coins with your real life money. I wish that they had a way that you could somehow earn the coins in game by playing and achieving certain goals. I also think this game needs more mobs they have all these biomes but so little animals they should have different animals and mobs for each biome. Just one idea for the game I had too was Eskimos can be like the villagers of the snow biomes. Finally, another issue I have is the LAG if I have a certain amount of worlds the game lags like crazy to where I can\u2019t play the game. I hope you consider these problems and think about ways to fix them and please get the updates to users at the same time. I have been a Minecraft user for many years and I would like to see the game be improved.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 73%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.4, 136.5K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#1 in Adventure"}, {"size": "237 MB", "three_star": "width: 7%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/funplus/id495598783?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Make friends and battle enemies across the globe, your dragon and throne await!With more than 50,000,000 downloads, players from nearly 150 countries, and countless recommendations by App Store, brace yourself for a legendary mobile adventure!Get your armor on, the hottest real-time MMO of 2019 is here!

One thing i don\u2019t like is how you can\u2019t get peace shields any other way but the alliance store plus its impossible to get enough alliance funds cuz the peace shield costs 60,000 game money but patience (LONG patience) is apparently the best way to get it. the monsters power levels around the kingdom are insanely crazy. to attack a level 7 you need like over 150k troop power but in pok\u00e9mon i can wipe out a monster in one hit at level 7.. see what i\u2019m saying game creators.. yeah it\u2019s bs. As a starting king/lord they should make it so players just starting get some time to be able to handle them selves and get a little strong over people that aim for low players to attack cuz their little girls and don\u2019t have big enough apples to attack someone there own tier.

Now, reinstalling the app on my phone after getting a new phone, the app asks me if I want to go \"Pro,\" and pay either $3.99 per week or something else per month, etc. Why do I not have full access to any of the features such as \"E-mail to myself, Save to Google Drive, etc.\"  So you guys just took my $10, let me use the app for a while, and now want to charge me a subscription on a WEEKLY basis? You're joking...then why would I recommend this app to anyone else because you can use Microsoft One Cloud drive or something and make PDF's as well, and there are alternative sources to make FREE PDF's as well, rather than using this app...Additionally, sometimes when trying to take a photo of the document, the AUTO border detection feature freaks out and is shaky and can't focus on the edges and takes pictures prematurely, cutting off edges of the intended document. Lame...again, what did I pay $10 for?? Not impressed with this app at all. Disappointed to say the least :( PLEASE FIX YOUR APP and stop trying to double charge me!</p>|The app itself works okay. Nothing spectacular, but gets the job done as far as a PDF scanner goes.Having said that, I am a pretty detailed person, and usually don\u2019t \u201csubscribe\u201d to services on accident. Matter of fact, I\u2019m not sure I ever have mistakenly subscribed to a service I didn\u2019t want. As other reviewers have suggested, the button placement combined with Face ID make it VERY easy to agree to a \u201cweekly\u201d subscription for $3.99 per week. I never check my personal email, and randomly I went in and saw a purchase for $8.XX. I started looking into it further - I have been billed weekly since I downloaded the app on Sept 5th for $3.99 per week until today, when I finally cancelled it on Jan 24th. Near $80 in total that I didn\u2019t knowingly authorize. Very, very sneaky. Shame on me for not checking my bank account or emails. But, shame on these developers for the \u201csneaky\u201d button placement and ease of access to a subscription based model of income.Buyer beware - this service is nowhere near worth $3.99 per week, even if you are aware of it or not. This developer should be banned from the app store for the sneaky trick they pulled.</p>|The scanner and the possibility of choosing from albums pictures is very good, also the pictures scanned are top notch. The only problem is that the developer let you use the app with some restrictions, and every time you touch the screen a reminder to buy the pro pops up which is annoying, also for some reason choosing from email to save into you album cause some problems with the email not recognized, at least in the free version you can not print or save the second page, in order to print or save the second document you have to delete the first one. In order to do this you have to click on the no thanks pop up purchase reminder, then choose the first document you want to delete.

I don\u2019t use the meal planner because I\u2019m a poor college student, so I don\u2019t do much grocery shopping, but the option is there and I really like the meals it offers. There are a few things I would change, but the pros so outweigh the cons that they\u2019re easy to pass over when deciding between 4 or 5 stars. One, I wish that it gave you the option to change the default warm up setting. Sometimes I forget to change it and it jumps right into the workout and I don\u2019t want that. Also, as someone else said, the mile tracker is wayyy off, but I\u2019m not super concerned with miles right now, I\u2019m just trying to build a cardio base, and I could always just use another app. Lastly, all the tapping is annoying at times, but so sometimes I just don\u2019t do it. I just remember what exercise is coming next and I do it. For the supersets I just use the clock at the top to count my 30 seconds. Overall, such a good app. I can\u2019t keep the subscription going because, like I said, poor college student and I\u2019m trying to afford a trip to Japan this summer, but holy cow I\u2019m still debating paying for it. I really do love this app. The workout counter keeps me motivated and on track and the workouts are so much fun. I\u2019m really seeing changes and I\u2019m really happy. Thanks Sweat Team!</p>|I love the way this app stays interesting. Lots and lots of diverse routines to try. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever willingly worked out this regularly in my life and not hated it. I\u2019ve lost 40 lbs in one year on this program and I honestly only participated in about a third of what was expected. You would be shocked at what your body can accomplish just by going for a walk when this app schedules you to. - other unexpected positives from this app: my two year old enjoys exercise now? Wasn\u2019t expecting him to want to participate so much. He even has his own little yoga mat, its cute. Second unexpected benefit from this app: I have minor joint problems and Sjana\u2019s yoga routines have given me Major relief over time. Also I found that Kelsey and Kayla\u2019s routine\u2019s were very hard, I was only able to complete about half of their sets. That being said I lost body fat VERY quickly, 20 lbs in less than 3 months to be specific, so I can\u2019t really complain about speedy results. Right now I\u2019m enjoying Sjana\u2019s yoga and it is amazing. Losing the rest of the weight more slowly but her routines are toning the crap out of my entire body, I have a lot more energy, and my flexibility has doubled. I didn\u2019t realize how much improved flexibility can make you feel younger, even at 34, I feel so much more like my kid self again.

However, I am so disappointed that I felt like I needed to share my experience. First, I love this game,  and I play it as an escape and for enjoyment. But, if you\u2019re playing it for an escape or for enjoyment, you obviously want to have a positive experience. You don\u2019t want to be frustrated with bugs and receive no response from support services in response to three inquiries over approximately a two week period of time.  Although there are many bugs with this program that drive me crazy, I am only going to comment on one.  They offer various challenges where you can earn rewards. I played the \u201cpanda race\u201c on three different occasions, and I believe I ended up in positions third, first, and first respectively (it\u2019s hard to know because if you don\u2019t get rewards, you never know where you have ended up, although I was playing with in a half an hour of the challenge closing, so I have a pretty good idea). After the first challenge, no rewards were offered. I complained. I did not receive a response. After the second challenge, no rewards were offered. I complained. I did not receive a response. During the third challenge, I complained again midway through. No response. Third challenge ended, no rewards and no response. And I did check my junk mail to make sure that the messages were not misplaced. Bubble games are a dime a dozen\u2026 I am going to have to check them out.</p>|That\u2019s it, I\u2019m finishing the coins I have, that the game doesn\u2019t rip me off by not fixing bugs for months that cause Me to lose. In one level I lost 4 balloons because when I aimed the balloon I was aiming near the basket with the next balloon, so it decided I was swapping balloons and sent the completely wrong color. Last time I updated this I got the same crap response with things to try not anywhere related to my issue. It was a generic response without even reading the problem, then contact us. No thanks, I\u2019ve wasted enough time repeatedly telling them the problem over months. Apparently bugs that cost the customer to lose games so they buy more coins, are not a high priority. I\u2019ll keep my money from now on. I reported a bug months ago where if you aim a ballon from the far left, probably 80-99% of the time when u let go it swaps the ballon to the next balloon in line and throws it. Almost always it\u2019s the wrong color and it causes u to lose a throw. After having to explain repeatedly and be asked to try the same basic steps more than once with no change. I reported or asked about it again a few months later, it was treated like it was new, asked to try the same pointless steps, I finally got a direct response that these things take time \ud83d\ude21 if I found any other games I liked, I would stop playing.</p>|UPDATE:  I\u2019ve been noticing that the developers have really pulled back on the rewards just recently.  It\u2019s their game and they can do what they want, but it is disappointing to have had them and then have them taken away.  (Examples:  used to occasionally get to watch a video for 10 extra balls; now it\u2019s 3; the end-of-month rewards used to offer 250 \u201ccoins\u201d if you reached black belt; now it\u2019s 60).  It does not make me want to spend real money; it actually de-motivates me to even want to play.I\u2019ve been playing a while now-at level 1,050.  Some levels are extremely challenging; others a little easier.  I like the variety and the helps that the developers are pretty generous with.  My one issue just cropped up in the past few days:  I\u2019ll get going on a game, be doing pretty well, and all of a sudden-everything freezes and the app crashes.  That is a bit frustrating.  I would give 5 stars if it weren\u2019t for that.  (Well, that and some of the ads are downright annoying; but since they give me something for them I won\u2019t complain; after all I don\u2019t have to actually watch them \ud83d\ude09)</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.6, 432.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#80 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "1.6 GB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/blizzard-entertainment-inc/id306862900?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Blizzard\u2019s award-winning card battler \u2013 experience the magic, mischief and mayhem with your friends.Requires an Internet connection and iPhone 5, iPod touch 6th Generation, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad mini 2 or newer.DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE.

The depth of gameplay is tremendous for a free-to-play.  I\u2019m not exactly sure what people expect to get for FREE.  The amount of content that is available at absolutely no cost makes HS a compelling part of my daily routine (don\u2019t want to miss the FREE gold for completing the daily quest.  Let me try an analogy: I can go outside with a friend and play baseball for free, just pick up a stick and a small rock and we\u2019re in business.  If we had a bat and a ball and maybe a glove or two it would still be fun (maybe more fun) but we definitely would be better at it.  Is the sporting goods store supposed to GIVE me the bat, ball, and gloves for nothing?  Or will I have to buy them...And regarding skill level, a professional baseball player would whoop up on me playing with a stick and a rock; same equipment, different skill level.  Same thing applies to HS.  Thankfully, the ranking system mitigates this a bit.  I play it because it\u2019s fun and I spend a little money because that makes it more fun.  For me. I admit I pre-order every expansion.  It\u2019s a good price for the number of cards/dust you get.  And relative to other forms or entertainment ($15 for a movie, $60 ($90 with DLC) for a video game) I really get my money\u2019s worth.  I\u2019m actually tempted to calculate the per hour entertainment value of all of my options but it would cut into my HS (and Fallout) time!</p>|Blizzard has built a beautiful game, the production value is abnormally high for a mobile game. The game has good mechanics, and a reasonable approach to \u201cfree to play\u201d IMHO. The paywall basically boils down to: you need to choose your engagement/investment level. If you want to play for free and slowly build your collection, you can do that... but, you probably won\u2019t be playing any super competitive decks with all the power cards for at least your first year, and will always make come budget compromises. If you want to fast-track into highly competitive play and run all the best cards, there is always $$$. Blizzard actually improved the F2P experience in a recent update by raising the baseline gold offered by all daily quests while also lowering their completion requirements. It\u2019s now easier and more rewarding to complete daily quests. Personally, I take a mixed approach and set a budget of what I\u2019m willing to spend on the game in a year and buy cards selectively at new set releases, then otherwise just operate using quest gold. Pick how you want to play, just please don\u2019t complain about the paywall. There are no \u201csurprises\u201d: you choose when and how much money you want to spend. If you want all the best cards, don\u2019t want to save for them and don\u2019t want to pay for them, then this probably isn\u2019t the game for you.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 66%;", "one_star": "width: 16%;", "star": "4.1, 15.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#35 in Card"}, {"size": "254.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/life360/id309681604?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Life360 is the world's leading realtime, location-sharing app, and is the best way to coordinate with family and friends.

I am so satisfied with this app &amp; as I have said before, I recommend it to friends &amp; family! - I've had this app for almost a year and have been satisfied with it until recently we (my family &amp; I) started having some issues with the accuracy of our locations and places we were shown as having been when we we're never in those areas.  As I wanted to get this app as I have two teens I wanted to test this out for myself as to not jump to conclusions and accuse anyone of not being where they say they will be.  I turned off my GPS and then waited 1 day to turn it back on and now I cannot have the app recognize that the GPS has been enabled once again. I have deleted the app as per the instructions and re-installed it, I have restated my phone (I have an iPhone 6s Plus) and followed those instructions.  I have gone to settings and made sure all the tabs are checked for my location including the background app refresh and the life360 still does not recognize me as having the GPS on.  This is a great concern to me and I did send a message to them, and the response was \"it's been sent to the developers\".  I really liked this app and has referred it to many friends, I truly hope this gets resolved quickly as I would like to continue using life360 and once this gets updated and fixed I will change my review.</p>|This is a must have app for parents and anyone with dependents (either children or parents) with compromised cognitive abilities. My wife found this app and placed it on my phone after an accident left me loss of short term memory. After the accident, I would literally get lost just trying to go home. My doctor independently recommended the same app to keep track of me. We now use it for everyone in the family, and always know where our kids are, even when they are traveling in a car. It gives everyone incredible peace of mind. We don\u2019t even have to call one another to meet up - we just use the app to track to whomever we are supposed to meet. And when someone is running late, say, to dinner, we can accurately predict when they\u2019ll arrive by tracking their travel. It\u2019s a really, REALLY useful app. And as the original family member for who it was purchased, it gave me great peace of mind knowing that even if I got lost, my family can track directly to me. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone with kids today, for pure safety reasons. You can track to your child\u2019s phone in real time, without help from anyone else, which is critical in the early moments of an abduction. I actually hate most apps and find most of them useless, so I cannot overstate how surprisingly pleased I was to finally find one that\u2019s actually very useful, very simple, very effective, and, in my case, very necessary.</p>|I use this to daily to see where my kids are on their commute to and from school and sports.  Two of my kids go to high school in a different state and one is a walker to her school.  I like seeing them er their safely without having to call them to distract them from driving.  Many times, we are in carpools to sports.  I can see if my kids are a few minutes away so I can warm up dinner.  Or when picking up, I can locate them and click on \u201cget directions\u201d and it takes me right to my child.  Sports complexes are big and sprawling.  So this helps me locate the exact field or side of the parking lot. One time, I knew a bad storm was coming and I could see that my son was only around the corner and would be home before the storm hit.  When my husband is away, I can see when his plane lands.  I can meet him easily.  I have used it to find my kid when we separate at the mall. So without this app, in order to find out where each person is and to get their eta .. it would take a phone call and conversation with each person.  I glance at my phone and get all that in seconds.  I don\u2019t have to distract them from driving to do so.  This is the most important app I have on my phone and cannot live without it.

I thought why not, sense the programmers had there chance to correct all problems. Maybe I should reevaluate this for them. So I did! I tried to turn it on, and it did turn on, it hung up after about an hour but it did get nearly a full hour of operation before it took a dump. This product needs someone to test it before they release it...still garbage!This app needs a lot of work. The only thing really consistent with it is that it consistently locks up. It not only the app, the same problem exists in the Norton WIFI program for you PC. They both stink! Somebody needs to have a chance to excel at another vocation because programming doesn't seem to be their forte and I'm sure they are getting paid an exorbitant amount of money to produce this garbage. The one nice thing is that you can turn it off...thank god for that one!This app seems to work better but still has issues when launching certain apps. I know HBO Now has a problem downloading data when the VPN is on. Also Hospital apps don't work and pandora has issues. Why these programmers can't fix it is unknown. You would think they would of had enough time even coming to work at 930 and leaving at 1pm and going on vacation every 3rd day.</p>|This app is a giant pain in the neck. It does not maintain a VPN connection on my iPhone 8, so I have to try to reconnect EACH time I want to use my phone, whether I\u2019m in a WiFi zone or just using cellular data. Reconnecting can take 2, 5, 7, or endless attempts, sometimes not connecting at all. Without connecting, I can\u2019t use my map app, my weather doesn\u2019t refresh, and so on. This makes my phone usability total garbage. For instance, yesterday I got caught in a construction zone and needed a quick detour. I tried to open my map app and it couldn\u2019t refresh with my location until the VPN connected. I tried to connect over and over, but it didn\u2019t work and I couldn\u2019t get a route. This has been happening the entire first month of my subscription, although the app worked much better during the trial period. I do not recommend this app. I really love the idea of a VPN, particularly when I\u2019m using a public WiFi, but being required to wait a few minutes or more each time I lift my phone to use it in my own home or when I\u2019m out on the road is a huge headache. I wish I would have cancelled before I got trapped in a full year\u2019s subscription.</p>|Yo so at first I was going to download this because I got a message saying I have 2 viruses from visiting \u201cadult websites\u201d and lets keep in mind I\u2019m a young teen just trying to play my lemon game which is really fun so I looked up cheats for it you know. Cause I couldn\u2019t get passed this one level so when I opened safari and looked up cheats and clicked the website the dumb notification came up. I\u2019m the only person who uses this devise so there\u2019s no way in the world that there\u2019s adult websites on it. I\u2019ve seen other people with the same complaint and the company just says something stupid about how it\u2019s a 3rd party seller and all but if this was an actual legit great working app then they would have taken down the scam by now. So dont even try to blame the 3rd party seller. Plus it\u2019s takes all of your money if you put your credit card number in. I\u2019ve seen a bunch of people say that too! I personally think apple should remove it from the App Store! But if you want your money stolen and to be scammed then this is the app for you!!!</p>", "four_star": "width: 22%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 51%;", "one_star": "width: 15%;", "star": "3.9, 5.8K Ratings", "category": "Productivity", "sub_rank": "#9 in Productivity"}, {"size": "217.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/moon-active/id470556954?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Join your Facebook friends and millions of players around the world, in attacks, spins and raids, to build your Viking village to the top!

VERY FRUSTRATING. I love this game, and still play it! This game has all the intricacies to be something great! A casino slot style interface with the addictive village building, upgrade platform. I loved this game when I first started playing! But as I progressed I realized that the game is rigged to be a cash cow for the developers. I will try to keep this short, although I have many things I\u2019d like to say. 5 spins an hour? Absolutely rediculous.. Gold cards? Try trading them. Literally impossible unless they unlock two, that\u2019s right, two cards to be traded. This only happens once a weekend, or even every other weekend. Out of spins and have some extra real money to throw at them? Don\u2019t worry, the slot machine becomes even more rigged when you were playing with the spins the game provides. The reels will be sure to literally land on the same 5 things and you\u2019ll maybe receive one \u201craid\u201d, \u201cattack\u201d, or any other objective in the game. Also, if you have a complaint about something that has happened in the game, for instance, I had thousands of spins disappear one day when I multitasked to another application, they will not provide any response, compensation, explanation, or even a breath in your direction.</p>|I enjoy playing this game and am around village 20+ so I've played for a bit of time. This game will spam the crap out of you with purchase prompts, ads and more. I'll breakdown the spam here: Load game- get attacked with 2 event pop ups and a package pop up. While playing, your screen may get a random ad out of nowhere you'll need to close (4 pop ups so far). Now while doing your spins if you dare increase bet past 1 and your spins is not evenly divisible by your bet (spin 2x for 11 spins, this happens at 1 spin left while spinning at 2x), the game will give you 3 pop ups, one to buy more spins, then a package, then a prompt to watch and add for A SINGLE spin. But if you got to this point by not doing 1 spin, you have probably 1 or 2 spins left, you need to use them so when you run out, now you get THREE MORE POPUPS!! This totals 10 pop ups.For the issue of this game: Cards are massively flawed. I have like 12 sets I have not fully collected, yet ever super rare chest (you barely get them besides upgrading village) I receive literally the same card duplicate. I have over 5 copies of the same card when there are over 10 more 1 stars I could get that I don't have!!! Nope here is a duplicate! If you play, an event to trade duplicates for chests to get cards appear but if you do this, you simply removed your 5 copies to get 1 of the same copy because the randomness is not random for cards!!</p>|The concept of the game is fun but the way the game is created you will not get very far in the game. I don\u2019t understand why you would make the game that way it makes your players lose interest. Spinning you can have full 50 spins and still won\u2019t get a shield, raid or attack. This happens for days. Next issue when building your village it\u2019s hard to complete when you have to fix an item multiple times after it was completed because you keep getting attacked. It will be really great if once an item is completed that item can not be hit. Maybe add \u201cMiss Attack\u201d option for picking an item that was completed and the reward can be the amount of Blocked Attack. Another BIG ISSUE is the cards. What\u2019s the point of still getting cards from sets that you have already completed, you can\u2019t get the rewards twice. If the set is completed you should not continue to get those same cards. For Gold Card event why all gold cards are not trade able. Again you can only use 1 card for your set what\u2019s the point of having 15+ of the same card. I really hope you start listening to your game players and all that I have said has been a problem for most players. There are many villages to complete so those few changes will not stop players from playing I\u2019m sure you will get players back.</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.6, 68.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#7 in Adventure"}, {"size": "435.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/jam-city-inc/id290671617?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Ready.

As an avid fan of Disney and Disney characters alike I really enjoy it. I play it regularly when I\u2019m having time to myself, just waiting or just to play. It\u2019s simple and colorful. It makes your mind work and makes it work fast due to most of the time you have to look for combos or just moves before you eye the time and see your emojis in a panic! I love it. They gave all the emojis character. Just like the actual animations and like real emojis. Best part about it you can even use the emojis. That being said and my koolaid has been drank. There are a few things that I could see helping keep players engaged and with friends too. The heart system could use the same tweak as the Tsum Tsum game(by line, check that out as well) where you can share hearts! I play so frequently that waiting isn\u2019t an option plus the events can take some time and hearts and you wanna be able to complete it but you have to wait for hearts. Also periodic lowered prices on power ups and boxes! It\u2019s fun to play and save up to be able to collect the emojis but there are occasions where that munny goes to the same emoji which yes powers up that emoji but when that happens you\u2019re out those coins or diamonds. I think sometimes doing purchase builds(where you purchase so many at a time each time you get a discount type thing) would be cool. All in all I give of four stars because I love it and it has potential. The music and gameplay is fun. Could use some updates though.</p>|I love this game, but mostly because I love Disney. I have a few suggestions to create more game flow. Lives should be increased, the amount should be more or they should replenish faster. Diamonds are not earned easily enough to use them for lives. They\u2019re better served for the diamond emojis. Collecting items that you already have, which then count for absolutely nothing for us, should be able to be placed in a marketplace place for other players to purchase from us so they can complete the round they need. A lot of the items need to be collected 9 or more times. This marketplace would encourage the coins to be spent on something other than gold emojis, which at this point is the only thing worth spending coins on. The events that take place are my favorite, however, the rounds where I don\u2019t have any of the emojis that give double points are very frustrating. We can\u2019t even choose which emojis we get when we purchase them, which is another problem that ties into this one. Everyone should have the option to use one emoji that gives double points, so every round should include at least one emoji that can be double points that the player already has. If we can\u2019t choose the emoji that we want when we purchase one, we should at least be able to choose if we want a new one or if we want to get a duplicate to level up. Also, we should be able to use coins to purchase diamonds. These ideas will give incentive for players to want to play MORE.</p>|This is a fun game that provides a good mental task and test for ones mind. It does help offer mental agility for all that play because it offers you multiple options to choose to reach a personal best or high score.My only thing I don\u2019t like is when you are in mid bonus round if you are offered to pay extra to continue, you loose the the bonus round gifts regardless. If you are given two free plays and you\u2019ve played 1 and pay to continue ... you loose the 2nd free play. Or if you\u2019ve just received both free plays and pay you still loose both free gifts of play. That\u2019s wrong. It also seems to take seconds away when you pay the 20, 30 &amp; 40 coins to continue. I\u2019ve counted with the extended play and it passes faster than the regular play routine true normal seconds count ??? That\u2019s my only displeasure with this app! Otherwise it\u2019s a wonderful app and offers a good mental challenge for any age group As well as offering different challenges that constantly change to keep the users interested and wanting to continue return to play to best their time and score with the multiple types of game styles offered in general or classic play. Then their monthly challenges that are set up for the players to set their skills up against other players on the web and friends that add an even great excitement to the ability to beating ones score weekly.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.7, 85.2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#90 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "220.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/elex-wireless/id424770549?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Clash of Kings is an MMORPG war game chosen by billions of players worldwide.
