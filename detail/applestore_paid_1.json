However there have been some bugs that aren\u2019t major but are a little annoying. One bug is where you are walking but every once in a while you look in a random direction if you look in a different direction while moving. Also bed spawns don\u2019t work well underground. I don\u2019t know if it is supposed to be like that but it would be nice if that was changed. I also have a problem with picking the original seeds. When I go to pick one in settings there is nothing there and it won\u2019t let me type in the seed. Thank you for reading this and if you don\u2019t have the game then get it nowThis is a new part I am adding on to my earlier review. Thank you for trying to make the game better with updates but there is too much you are adding on. The textures should not have been messed with (accept glass ;)) because it ruined the classic feeling of the game. Also the cross bow should be easier to use because you have to click after you pull back the arrow and click again to release it. But I guess the easy aim makes up for it. I do like the water features but there is no use for turtles because all they have dropped is different sea plants. The treasure maps are reeeeealy cool though. You can find good loot but some things are not usable (heart of the sea). It could be that I don\u2019t know how to use it but there should be an easier way to look at how you use it.</p>|I love Minecraft, it is a great multiplayer game and I think it has really come a long way since the beginning. I have been playing Minecraft since the release of the first game, and it has just gotten better and better. But this game could use some improvements especially for mobile users. I feel like the computer users of Minecraft get updates quicker. For instance I have seen people on computers that have the full aquatic update , while I\u2019m on an iPad and I am only now getting news of this update plus it is coming so slowly. Another problem I have with this game is the in-app purchases I mean I know they have added coins but you still have to buy those coins with your real life money. I wish that they had a way that you could somehow earn the coins in game by playing and achieving certain goals. I also think this game needs more mobs they have all these biomes but so little animals they should have different animals and mobs for each biome. Just one idea for the game I had too was Eskimos can be like the villagers of the snow biomes. Finally, another issue I have is the LAG if I have a certain amount of worlds the game lags like crazy to where I can\u2019t play the game. I hope you consider these problems and think about ways to fix them and please get the updates to users at the same time. I have been a Minecraft user for many years and I would like to see the game be improved.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 73%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.4, 136.4K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#1 in Adventure"}, {"size": "147.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/warner-bros/id298372283?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "It's the game The New York Times called a \"Sensation,\" and Cosmopolitan said \"will be the best dollar you've spent.\" Heads Up! is the fun and hilarious game from Ellen DeGeneres that she plays on her show, and you can play with your friends!From naming celebrities, to singing, to silly accents -- guess the word on the card that\u2019s on your head from your friends' clues before the timer runs out!Play one of the many exciting categories, or create a category all your own!Features:- Play with one friend, or one hundred at the same time.- Draw a new card simply by tilting your phone.- Keep videos of your hilarious game play for your own amusement, or share them right to Facebook.- Diverse categories let you challenge your smartypants friends and entertain your kids for hours, all from one app!With 40+ themed decks packed to the brim with exciting gameplay cards, the fun will never stop!Decks include:- Celebrities- Movies- Animals- Accents- Characters- And lots more!Game-nighters, your app is here.</p>", "subtitle": "Trivia on the go", "title": "Heads Up!", "similar": "  100 PICS Quiz - Picture Trivia\n,  Charades!\u2122\n,  Wheel of Fortune: Show Puzzles\n,  Words With Friends 2 Word Game\n,  Words With Friends \u2013 Word Game\n,  Infinite Word Search Puzzles\n", "two_star": "width: 0%;", "price": "Infrequent/Mild Mature/Suggestive Themes", "inapp_purchase": "N,/,A", "autor": "Warner Bros.", "reviews": "|I love playing this game with my friends, but it\u2019s disappointing that we can\u2019t hear ourselves in the videos because the game sound effects dominate the microphone.

Its not 100% accurate 100% of the time, but you honestly can\u2019t expect it to be with something as diverse as plants. So far almost all of the plants I\u2019ve tried this out on have been accurate (and I\u2019ve been doing it on plants that I already know) and most of the ones where the best guess wasn\u2019t correct had the correct plant in the \u201cif it\u2019s not this, then it might be one of these\u201d area at the bottom of the screen.For those of you that are salty about the app not being perfectly accurate every single time, you have to understand that with something like plants, many species are extremely similar to each other, and you can\u2019t forget that these are living things with their own diversity amongst their own kind. You might have two red clovers side by side, but they\u2019re not going to be *exactly* the same. The fact that this app is accurate more than 50% of the time is phenomenal, let alone the fact that probably 20 of the 30 something plants I\u2019ve snapped have been correct.The more people that add photos and data to this app, the more accurate it will be! Do not expect perfection, but expect to be wowed at how wonderful it is. I highly recommend the tutorials on how to take the best photos for the app to best \u201cread\u201d the picture as well, they\u2019re very helpful.</p>|I absolutely love this app and cannot say enough good things about it. I love walking through different botanical gardens, greenhouses, or even just hiking, and now when I\u2019m curious about a plant, or just think it looks interesting I can use Plant Snap! Not only does this let me look back on the plant later, but I also learn a lot of information about it. However I do have one improvement that would make the app even better. Because I love plants so much, I own several and was so happy that I could organize them online on Plant Snap. However I wish there was a section that talked about plant care specifically for that pant you take a picture of. I know this is a monumentally huge task given how many plants are in the system, but my primary use for the app is for organizing plants I grow myself. It would be really beneficial to learn growing technics (how difficult, how much water/sunlight, etc) for the plants you snap. Often times I\u2019ll snap a plant in the wild and want to buy it from a nursery but I\u2019ll have to leave the app and google the information instead of it being presented within the app. Overall though this is an amazing app and I am very happy with my purchase! Thank you so much for creating this app and continue to release amazing updates \ud83c\udf31</p>|This app is truly amazing, despite it not always providing an EXACT match every single time. No two plants look exactly the same, but this app provides more than one result, and from the other options, you can find other plants in the same family, look that up in the search icon, and you can narrow your results down quite easily and soon find your plant! It\u2019s almost IMPOSSIBLE to get your exact match by just snapping a picture and that\u2019s not the apps fault necessarily because the diversity in plants is just too wide for any database to pinpoint an exact match first time around, but it does give you many different approaches to finding your plant in the end. All it takes is a little patience:) As for a suggestion towards the future update to improve the app\u2019s function, I wish that there was a way that you could add plants to your collection from what you search in the search bar. I would love to document all of my plants in my collection, even the ones that I already know the names of, but I have to go through the process of taking a picture, suggesting a name, and then finding my plant and adding it that way. It\u2019s not the end of the world, but I would still love for that to be a new feature!</p>", "four_star": "width: 16%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 66%;", "one_star": "width: 7%;", "star": "4.3, 23.4K Ratings", "category": "Education", "sub_rank": "#92 in Education"}, {"size": "118.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ndemic-creations/id525818842?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Can you infect the world?

I haven't played it when it was free.  But it is amazing.  I've read plenty of reviews saying the game is too hard. I don't know if the game has had a massive rebalance or not, but it doesn't seem that way.  I've beaten every plague in game on casual with relative ease, and normal without too much effort.  It isn't a pay to play experience, unless you're impatient. There are many in-app purchases.  Many people are angry about it, but I believe there are reasons.  First of all, there is a computer game called Plague Inc. Evolved.  All of these features are included for free in the 15 dollar game.  If you want, you can have the Plague Inc. Evolved experience for about the same price on your phone.  You get the core game for the basic price.  And it is worth it.  If you really enjoy the game you can support the Developers by buying things.  I did so with the Neurax Worm.  I believe you can also unlock the Vampire and Ape plagues by beating all the basic plagues on brutal.  All in all, the game is amazing.  If you think it sounds interesting, get it. You'll enjoy it.Thanks for reading!</p>|The game is very addictive and absolutely a ton of fun. I\u2019ve spent days playing it and going through all the different difficulties the game has to offer and even bought a couple of the dlc desease types. My only smaller complaint (why I have 4 stars) is one I can understand but still bumps me out. The pc version has a couple more things than this version. And I can totally understand that it takes a while for the updated to be brought into mobile, I would still love to see the multiplayer option in the game. I can\u2019t stress enough how many times I\u2019ve wanted to play the game with a friend since they\u2019re also a fan of this game. In all this is a very great game, worth the money but keeping in mind it isn\u2019t a game everybody will find exciting. But it is really fun and I recommend checking the game out.I would love to know if a multiplayer option is ever to be released for the game, it really bumps me out not to see one and it would really add replay value if one was added.

I was worried it was a shell app, with any specifics requiring in-app-purchases. This was NOT the case. It's complete, stand-alone, and detailed.I have used this app to help me locate neuroanatomical structures doing my study of the brain, and it has served me well. The models are detailed and there are tons of useful features with a reasonably low learning curve. Not all things are perfectly intuitive, but they aren't too difficult to figure out and get used to. One feature I haven't yet found is a back button that reverts to the previous view: occasionally I'll accidentally click something and the view will radically change, and I can't easily navigate back. Another useful feature for neuroscientists would be BA/functional regions, and I would gladly pay for an in-app-purchase to get them. Fantastic. Best App I have found for studying the brain.//UPDATE: due to Apple's servers being down, after updating the app it appeared that I needed to buy it again. This was just a temporary glitch, and not he fault of this app. After Apple got their servers back up everything was great again, but it's a shame that a problem of Apple's led to it looking like this app was trying to make me pay twice. Not the fault of the devs, and they should be compensated for the bad reviews (mine included) that were written at this time.</p>|Unbelievable, wonderful, fantastic app! I'm not one to take time to write reviews. But I have to thank the developers of this incredibly useful tool. I am a singing teacher who focuses on functional technique, i.e. the way the larynx and its surrounding structures move (thus influencing how the larynx functions). Mine is a relatively unusual approach to teaching vocal technique, but I get amazing results with my students from this methodology. For years I've been looking for a book, pictures, diagrams that can show me practically how the muscles of the larynx &amp; pharynx are layered so I can understand which muscles to release or contract. And  this app does it all (except showing me how the intrinsic muscles of the larynx move). This app allows me to FADE muscles so I can see what's underneath them. It shows me the nerves innervating the larynx, the blood vessels, the membranes, etc.Thank you, thank you, thank you! I can show my massage therapist, my physical therapist and my chiropractor specifically what to work on now.I look forward to add on features to this amazing app. I've been sharing it with my students as well, so you have an enthusiastic (if not evangelical) marketing consultant in perhaps an unexpected client base. Brands! Bravo!</p>|I am a faculty member teaching Point of Care ultrasound to medical students and residents and physicians and I found the app very helpful to review anatomical details and also to develop course content. It would be very helpful to have corresponding ultrasound images in both labeled and unlabeled  format with some animations in augmented reality for the ultrasound images with both normal and pathological findings. Point of care is a rapidly growing area of ultrasound and will be an integral part of medical education as well as education for medical residents and so it would be great to have that feature as well. Something to look into and if you need any tips you can look at some ultrasound simulation products by companies like Simbionix 3D systems and CAE. For sure that feature would be welcomed by the medical community and will address a real need in medical education.

The glasses make it hard to add any other affects or make the eyes clearer! This is something that completely ruins my experience with this app because I am always wearing my glasses. If you wear glasses I wouldn\u2019t download because you completely get jipped! If you don\u2019t wear glasses this is an amazing app to edit all of your photos. The only other thing I would say is don\u2019t go overboard editing your photos you are amazing just the way you are and I would only use this app for minor fixes such as a few of your biggest blemishes or lighting problems. I would NEVER use this app to completely change your image because you should always be true to who you are.Lastly never use FaceTune on your profile pictures or any other pictures that lots of people can see if they don\u2019t like your looks they have everything wrong and you shouldn\u2019t change for them. FaceTune should add some kind of disclaimer about being true to you!</p>|This is an incredible, highly natural-looking, highly powerful face tune app! My only comment is to try and be mindful of when and how you use it, it\u2019s very easy to become obsessed with hyper-fixing pictures of yourself. I would absolutely not recommend it to anyone younger than 15 and/or anyone who already has issues with self-confidence- you\u2019re beautiful just the way you are! I wish the app included some sort of disclaimer about that, especially for younger teenagers, y\u2019know?Personally, I try to limit my uses of it to things I wouldn\u2019t feel too duped by someone else doing: removing red-eye, non-personal issues with a picture (a stray thread on my shirt, for example), and maybe my two or three biggest pimples/pimple scars. You do you though: as long as it\u2019s used mindfully, it\u2019s a really cool tool to have!</p>|I\u2019m not even going to lie I was suppper skeptical with this app, being the fact that EVERY celebrity/YouTuber/Ig model uses this app and I never saw the point on \u201cfixing\u201d your face with an app, but within \u201cfixing\u201d one photo I found myself 2 hours later \u201ctouching\u201d up more selfies. I hate to admit but I\u2019m extremely addicted to using Facetune now. I HIGHLY recommend downloading this app. It\u2019s worth it. It is SUPER easy to use and it even shows you how to use each function and if you forget while using one of the functions, all you have to do is click the question mark by the function AND it even has a video to show you how to use each function.

But please devs if you can read theese listen to this. Im sure your going to bring back the chipper, engineer, and dartling but could you focus more on those towers instead of buffing/nerfing the other towers? Also, i love the heroes. These are a great twist to the original game but i mean, the first 4 were enough. I wouldnt add any more if i were yall. I suggust one beginner hero (quincy) one powerful one(qwen) one explosive/medium power one(jones) one cash one(ben) and one support one that gives other monkeys buffs, extra cash, lives and dosent really attack. Also, a bit on knowledge. Love the idea, im level 72 and it takes roughly a week of grinding to rank up and get another point. Can you make it so we can buy the points in bulk, use monkey money, and give us like 2 or 3 points after say rank 60? Last suggestion, pinapples and spikes. I dont want to spend 25 monkey money every time 1 ceramic gets past my defences instead of just putting down like 8 road spikes like in btd5. Finally, bring back random challenges. Those were always fun. And honestly make more things we can buy with monker money, like actual monkey individual upgrades like btd5, Finally please, add co-op mode soon.The game will start to get slightly booring soon and i would love a new major upgrade. One final thing. In btd5 bannana farms were a lot more useful. And you could get lots of money. Why the insane nerf guys?Thanks- Mr_Freese(ninjakiwigamertag)</p>|The alchemist and Druid are great additions and I love playing games with those two towers. However there is no bloon chipper, engineer, mortar tower, and Dartling gun. The 3D feature is fantastic and the 3 different upgrade paths make it more difficult of which to upgrade. Another issue about this game however is the lack of maps compared to btd6. The next issue I have with this btd game is the home screen. In btd5 you have a interactive screen clicking of different buildings to do stuff. However now they are simple square buttons. He finally the last flaw that could be fixed is the amount of money money you get and what to spend it on. Their is a lack of good special agents or power ups, that aren\u2019t has good as btd5. I find myself rolling around in monkey money very early on in the game. I have two ideas to solve this. One is to create the building upgrades in btd5 you can clear some land to build a building to give some special abilities to the towers. The second way is that you can exchange monkey money for money knowledge. This trade in can be very expensive giving 1000 monkey money for 1 monkey knowledge or even 2000 for 1. This is a great addition to he btd series and deserves its spot on btd6. I do think that btd5 right now it better in some areas now then btd6 because it\u2019s been out for much longer. This game is definitely worth he asking price and I can\u2019t wait to see what they do next.</p>|Now, BTD5 was great, but this, this is alot better. Like, A LOOOTTTT BETTER. Well, first of all, it is missing some stuff. The bloon chipper, engineer, dartling gunner, and mortar are all missing, but it did only recently come out, so i expect those in later updates. In case you couldn't tell, its 3-D, which is a major step up. It has way more new stuff, and some reused stuff, like the DDTs from bloons monkey city. I have seen a lot of similarities between BTD6 and BTDx, the fan game. For example, they both have five tiers, and there is the alchemist monkey, along with some upgrades in common. However, BTD6 has other different things, like fortified bloons. There are three upgrade paths, and 5 tiers, but you can only have one tier five per path, and up to a 5/2/0 and so on. There is another new moab, aside from the DDTs, called the B.A.D. It is stronger than the ZOMG, and pops into 4 ZOMGs and a few DDTs. The sandbox mode is much better, and there are new gamemodes. There is monkey knowledge , which is WAAAAYYY too complicated to get in to here, and there are four monkey heroes. Each monkey hero can level up to level 20, and they get two activated abilities, one at level 5, and one at level 10. There is a whole lot of other content too, but this post is getting too long. So, overall, i would totally recommend. 100% worth the 5 bucks! Also, this is the first review i have ever written, thats how good i think this game is!</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 86%;", "one_star": "width: 2%;", "star": "4.8, 37.3K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#1 in Action"}, {"size": "244.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/fifth-star-labs-llc/id451087546?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Sky Guide makes stargazing simple.

It began giving me a sense of this grand scale of a solar system we live in... a perception only reinvigorated few times through the words of someone like Carl Sagan describing the Pale Blue Dot. I looked at my phone and immediately opened this app again to just look at space. As I wondered to my back door I realized that I was fortunate enough to be waking outside into a cloudless night. I turned on night view mode, turned down my display brightness, and let the ambient music of this app play. I was alone, along with the living silence of night with the smooth, soothing music playing on the app. I looked up with my phone, navigating amongst the constellations, in awe at how the sight could be so beautiful, seemingly unique every time, and so often taken for granted. Realizing the opportunity, I searched for satellites via the app and eagerly moved my phone around the sky to track the paths of Coos Rockets that were flying by and anticipating the next flyover from our man-made moons. As much as I adore the night sky in all its grand beauty, this app makes exploration even more satisfying, concise, and exploratory than I otherwise would have been able to do. Thank you.</p>|Had this app for a while and still my favorite. However, I\u2019m confused about the updates. There was a recent update that added Chiron, for example, but it is not listed under the \u201crecently added\u201d section. Additionally, even when I look for it manually, it just points to where the object is, but there is no image associated with the description, nor can you zoom into it.  At the same time, other recently added items, such as RS Puppis, has the image and location, but no description (you have to tap on the image of the star within the image - like a star within a star - to get a separate description).  Doesn\u2019t seem like the recently added section is working properly within the app.  Is it just not updating correctly or am I missing something???Also, since very recent updates, the star brightness feature that requires 2 fingers to adjust directly on the screen is so overly sensitive that I am constantly having to adjust the brightness as I navigate the sky map. Very very frustrating. Is there no way to lock that feature or disable it?Otherwise, still amazing.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 89%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.9, 129.1K Ratings", "category": "Reference", "sub_rank": "#1 in Reference"}, {"size": "49.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/jackadam/id461812081?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Dark Sky is the most accurate source of hyperlocal weather information.

I had never even heard of that before but I get sunstroke allllll the time and that feature is fabulous.  The hourly precipitation prediction is both attractive and insanely useful in places like New York, allowing you to time a mad dash during a lull in the storm. This app has features that no other application for tracking the weather has: it\u2019s in my top five apps that I use and I use it every day. It works just as accurately in every country that I go to and every state that I go to, all with different types of weather challenges. I just love it.

Opening it showed no data. So, I searched for a new one.Dark Sky is not intuitive and the opening page shows me the temperature and if it\u2019s rising or falling. I sort of knew that before I opened the app. It then shows what the conditions will be for the next 16 hours. It also indicates what the sky will look like and in percentages. That\u2019s good. At the bottom of the page there are switches giving you the choice of humidity, UV index, temperature, and wind speed, but it took a few times before I realized that you must scroll down to get the switches. Then, although it doesn\u2019t tell me, you can sweep to the left or right to get more information. To the right, it give you the high and low for the next seven days. Again, okay, but just the temperature. I want see frontal systems, lows and highs. Having been an aviator, weather is important to me. I can\u2019t do anything about it, but I like to be prepared. That left swipe gives me a monochromatic map of the western US. With only light blue blotches. Zooming in on my home, I get somewhat vague images of what appear to be rain - no clouds that I can determine. It\u2019s an okay app, but I find when I pay for a app that is not as good as a free one, I\u2019m irritated. $4.00 isn\u2019t much since there are no ads, but here in the West I want to see where my mountains and deserts are if I am planning a trip to cross the Cascade in the winter.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 73%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.4, 40.6K Ratings", "category": "Weather", "sub_rank": "#1 in Weather"}, {"size": "39.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bobby-li/id1330451887?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Build your own city as the new mayor.

It makes so much more sense to just offer a game for a few dollars that moves quickly and offers challenges (crime, city management, natural disasters). I would love to see some more types of trees (specifically palm trees/ cacti that you can build to improve environment), and just more building options (maybe themes that are unlocked by certain monuments?) Ex: If you unlock the pagoda, and build it, it would be awesome if it also unlocked a new theme of buildings (and trees, parks, etc.) (in a different tab so that you can select between different themes for different zones in the same city). It would also make it more appealing to build multiple cities with their own landscape (like a whole city in the desert; something you can\u2019t rlly do now bc all the houses have grass). Maybe add more levels to unlock these theme packages, or even if you have to do in app purchases, for an app this great. I really really appreciate the ease of building \u201czones\u201d rather than having to wait hours, days, or weeks for something to get built, and I feel like having themes would be a great way to offer options without there being too many randomizations on one type/size building. Also I love Sandbox mode, great for if you want to just mess around and see what works well. Great app. 10/10, have already recommended to friends.</p>|This is what SimCity should have been. Fantastic city builder good for a few minutes or a few hours. I like the leveling system which keeps you from getting ahead of yourself and gives you specific goals to work toward. And _NO_ IAP! Thank you so much for an honest, premium game! Lots of little touches to keep it from being a mere clone with a quirky sense of humor. There\u2019s even a sandbox mode. Hard to believe this game comes from a one-man studio. At launch there are still a few problems. The graphics are a bit soft as you zoom in, even at highest settings. Not so much as to be a bother, but you notice it. I\u2019ve had two crashes but no data loss, so not a big deal. Have had an issue with power plants not plugging into the grid properly when incorporating highways into my city design (you still need normal roads, but the game doesn\u2019t always register the connection even then.)This dev has been actively engaged with his user base, so I feel certain these very minor bumps will get ironed out. Don\u2019t let it worry you \u2014 this game is worth way more than the asking price. If you like city builders (and old school SimCity in particular) then you need to own this game.</p>|This game is super fun, it\u2019s the best city builder out there. The only problem is that I feel like there should be more assets, like more power plant options, more special buildings, and just alternate forms of transportation. An underground subway would be awesome. Another thing is that the game starts to run slow really quickly, it would be nice if it could be more optimized, this is coming from an iPhone X user, so hardware shouldn\u2019t be the issue (Although I noticed that once my phone heated up the game played much worse, and when I played the same, very populated city later, once my phone cooled down, performance was back to normal, I think the X might just thermal throttle). The first problem I noticed was that even with the textures set to ultra things still looked fuzzy and blurry, especially the pictures of the people when they talk for a mission. Other than more unique game elements, a need for better optimization, and blurry textures this game is fantastic and you should definitely buy it.

This isnt a typing issue I'm using a saved password entry. This compounded an issue where this past Saturday a scheduled shift did not sync to my calendar at all. The email notification had it and online website had it but the calendar sync omitted Saturday but not Friday not Sunday.

Oh, right, because hotschedules did yet ANOTHER nonsense update, and without downloading the update you cant login.

Thus losing my login data each time, thus making me download a new version (needing wifi) and requiring me re-verify my identity and password each time I use it? It\u2019s annoying.

I would list everything wrong with this app/program, but that would take entirely too long. Let\u2019s just recap the main reasons why this HotSchedules is the bane of my existence.... 1.) the website OR app fail to work 50% of the time. 2.) it is completely unrealistic for a large business as not more than one person can work on a schedule at a time. 3.) it\u2019s wiped ENTIRE schedule I had wrote out for 3 months in advance. 4.) customer service (lack thereof) is non existent. 5.) the only updating they care about is the appearance of the app, absolutely no concern with the functionality of the program itself. 6.) we ACTUALLY have to pay for this monstrosity of an app and to use it for your business.

Firstly, updates come all the time and you can create your own levels! In the level editor, you can use triggers,make gameplay, or deco to make your level get a feature! A feature or epic is when robtop notices your level and gives it a rating feature or the highest honor of an epic!!! A rating gives you 1 cp, a feature gives 2 cp, and epics give 3! That\u2019s not all! You can also play others levels in this game as well! Some creators I recommend are funnygame, serponge,optical,viprin, or danolex! For these levels, there is a huge gap in difficulty! They go from automatic wins to near on impossible! The difficulties are: auto,easy,normal,hard,harder,insane,easy demon, medium demon,hard demon,insane demon, or the legendary difficulty of EXTREME DEMON!!!!!!!!! Some great players are: riot,surv,diamondsplash,srguiester, and knobbelboy! Wow! And the best thing about this game? It focuses not on the game, but the community. Don\u2019t just think I will look over the cons though. Some players are hackers who hack some players\u2019 accounts! Some include anaban, anaban v666   0, and others! Also, there are abusers who claim to be criminals! But they mostly just get banned by the legendary ELDER MODS! :):):):) Elder mods keep the game safe from hackers. This is a very smart choice! There are some bugs as well, but these are fixed quickly after recognition. Overall, this is a very safe, wonderful app! Download today!!!!</p>|Hi, let me just say I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Its awesome and it\u2019s fun and you can make levels!!  So I read the reviews to know if other people liked it too! But I saw a review saying if this game is ok, it said mostly bad things (some are not true) about this game. So I\u2019m gonna tell you at the end of this review if this game is ok \ud83d\udc4c. 1. This game is NOT a learning game. (You maybe all know that \ud83d\ude02) you don\u2019t learn numbers, or letters, it\u2019s more like a skill game! 2. The music is not bad music. It\u2019s just a remix! Their are no words, so don\u2019t worry about someone saying bad words. Idk if you can make it say words, but their are no words or bad words \ud83d\ude09. 3. Idk if this game is an online game. If you don\u2019t want your child to play with random people, then watch your child if they play this game. When I play, I don\u2019t play online, so it\u2019s kinda not an online game \ud83e\udd17. Ok, so this game IS ok! It\u2019s great, awesome, and tests ur skills! Even you can\u2019t learn numbers, and letters on this game, it\u2019s still a great game! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude03 about the online thing, it\u2019s maybe not, just watch ur child to make sure. It\u2019s a really good game! You should download this for your child! If you see the review that says \u201cit\u2019s a bad game\u201d don\u2019t listen to him / her. They maybe just lost a level and wants to make everyone give up on this game. Bye and have a awesome day! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude09\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude03</p>|This game is AWESOME!!!!!! I love the cool soundtracks, I love unlocking new levels and cubes A.k.a. icons, and I love being able to do this for a reason becuz completing a lvl will unlock more levels, icons, and more! The best thing that I most love about this app is that u can actually make a level. Yes!, u can make a lvl!!! AND!!!: u can post them so the WHOLE world \ud83c\udf0e can see  that lvl u made!!! AND: u can see THOUSANDS of other lvls that other peeps made!!!!! This game just NEVER gets old!!! I'm SUPER good at this game and have completed what the call a demon lvl. It's a super hard lvl and I've done \u2705 1083 of those. I've maxed out all the lvl that the RobTop \"made\" from FingerDash (last one) on the 7th time to finish it to the very first one. There's NO in app purchases wish is awesome, there's NO adds wish is sweet, and there's always a possibility of this game!!! And if for some reason u don't feel good at this game or ur getting very frustrated, don't quit GD! (GD: G: geometry D: Dash). Start at the easiest lvl u can do. Make up your way to being the BEST player in the world \ud83c\udf0e!

I was so unhappy that I took the time to write this review. I use to have the original Game of LIFE for my iPod Touch years ago and it was perfect...so similar to the original physical board game. I just spent about 15~20 playing this version and it was absolutely horrible. The game board is nothing like the original board, everything seems overcrowded. The money system is also very different, players are given a much larger amount of money. Third and most upsetting to me is the fact that I can only use the default icon and car for my character. Anything else you must pay to have. I never thought something like this would happen to mobile gaming. I understand paying for larger features, but there\u2019s nothing special about the purchases offered in this game. I already had to pay $2.99 for the game and now I have to pay more just to have a different appearance in the game? Nothing will be as good as the old Version. All they care about is making you pay for addition features that should already be free. If you enjoy playing The Game of LIFE as much as I do, please, PLEASE do not buy this game.</p>|First off, the game is expensive for what you get to do. You don\u2019t get to Customize your pegs or even the car that you get without having to pay for it. The game is extremely repetitive, I feel as if the game already programs what you\u2019re going to be landing on because I land on the same things almost every single time which can\u2019t be coincidence. The jobs that you get whether it\u2019s career or college are the same every time which is only 4 options. In the original game you have a lot more options. In this game if you have children you automatically get $50k for each child but in the original game you had expenses for child care, college for the kids, etc. Obviously you\u2019re going to choose to have a child each time to cash in at the end. You have a lot of chances to gain money but not a lot of chances to lose it which I find boring. The whole point is that you have as many equal chances to win as you have to lose. The only thing I like are the mini games which I find amusing when you land on them. Overall, really bad game....</p>|The game comes to a rather abrupt end on the free board. You go from collecting babies to the risky/safe path and then suddenly you\u2019re in retirement within two or three spins. Old board games and online versions used to draw this portion out and from my estimate, your life isn\u2019t over that fast! I\u2019m fond of being able to own more than one house or forgoing a house entirely. Otherwise the mini games give the mobile version a nice twist on the game. It\u2019s a little hard to justify a season pass with so much locked up behind a paywall. I need more to convince me the game is worth it. I don\u2019t feel like I got my money\u2019s worth of what I did pay. If the old fashioned game isn\u2019t the length I remember it to be, then what good is that? It makes me unwilling to pay for more. Needs more content for the free version to make me willing and eager for more. Simply passing and barely so.

Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.

As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!

Now as an adult I tried to play it again on my laptop and it lagged and then I discovered this wonderful game was made into an app! I was so happy when I saw it and I\u2019ve been playing it nonstop. The only thing I am disappointed with is the fact that you can\u2019t play through the holidays in this version. One of the best parts of all the papa\u2019s games is playing through the different holidays and seasons, and being able to decorate your lobby accordingly. I\u2019ve already bought every upgrade and every lobby decoration available and now it\u2019s like why am I still getting paid if there\u2019s no shop to spend the money anymore? Other than that it\u2019s still a great game and I\u2019m so thankful for the app version!! No lag or issues so far!</p>|It\u2019s suchhhh a fun gameee, and I just wanted to suggest that you add more things to buy/things to spend your money on, because I have over $1,000 and already bought everything in the shop. In addition, I own the automatic building machine (when building the sundae) and every once in a while, when it is perfect and in the green, it doesn\u2019t say \u201cawesome\u201d with coins popping out, not sure if this is a bug or not. Lastly, I would also suggest that when adding whipped cream it shouldn\u2019t go straight to the other toppings without an option to add a different whipped cream, because I accidentally tapped the cup and it poured regular whipped cream when I meant to add chocolate whipped cream so it would be nice to be able to at least add chocolate whipped cream on top.</p>|I use to play this game all the time on the computer and when I found out they had an app, I was really excited. I still like the game but the computer version is better. The computer has more items you can purchase and you can decorate your own store. The items you buy not only help your waiting score, but they can help your topping score too. You even have to be strategic in how long you leave an item in the shop as decoration, because overtime it loses its value. I\u2019m assuming they had to scale down because it\u2019s a phone. Still like the game just wish the number of customers increased more frequently to make the game more challenging.</p>", "four_star": "width: 19%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 57%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.1, 654 Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#4 in Simulation"}, {"size": "127.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ninja-kiwi/id386241773?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Five-star tower defense with unrivaled depth and replayability.

Number two when you select a map difficulty with the difficulty of the game itself no matter what you pick it send you into some game where anyone has clicked one of the things that you have for instants I play on expert maps and impoppable, sometimes I also add in advanced maps but yet it will put me into a game playing on impoppable with an easy map this will decrease the reward from say $1200 to $360 monkey money.. and it\u2019s just way too easy at that.. Now the only other thing that we have discussed between me and my friends that play this is it would be nice to be able to speed it up even more than the one time speed because these matches on impoppable go on for a long time so speeding it times 3 when ur fully set to win by round say 50 u won\u2019t have to wait till round 85 as the rounds get longer each round..</p>|So this game is one of the most addicting and thought inducing games I have ever played on the phone. I am level 70something and the only thing that makes me quit is that I get to the point where I\u2019m on round 260 and the rounds take too long. The multiplayer (co-op through Facebook) is complete garbage. If you get a notification, it disconnects. That is not the phone it is the game because I have an iPhone 6s and the person I try to play with has a galaxy 6 or 7 I can\u2019t remember. Anyways, you can\u2019t pause or exit for 1 second even just out of the app or phone lock and it\u2019s the most frustrating thing ever when you get to round 78 and you are about to start kicking things up and it quites you for absolutely no reason. It\u2019s the worst feeling in the world and extremely annoying/aggravating. If you guys can make this better, that would completely perfect the game and make it the very best game on mobile for a very very very long time.

I love it so much so that I actually gifted my mom this app as well so she can have a simple, yet amazing app to edit her photos with. It is super easy to navigate! But there are a few things that I think the developers should put into consideration\u2026When using the app from the photos app on iPhone\u2026 It sometimes turns black, the photo disappears and it is starting to get a tad bit annoying at this point\u2026 I am unsure if this is just me or what, but if someone from the Afterlight Dev team sees this, I need you to try to do this\u2026 Go to the photos app, choose a photo, press \u201cedit\u201d on the top right of the photo, press the three dots (...) that is just left of the red \u201crevert\u201d button. If afterlight isn\u2019t showing on the tab that popped up, then go to \u201cmore\u201d on the very right, then toggle afterlight \u201con\u201d , then press done, open afterlight from the photos app (don't go to the actual afterlight app), then try editing, mess around with different tools and see if the picture you\u2019re editing randomly turns black or disappears, and if it does then can you guys please issue a fix for it? Either that or make it to where I can modify the original photo from the afterlight app so i don't have a duplicate.</p>|After using the 1st Afterlight app for a few years I couldn\u2019t wait to get the newest creation. I absolutely loved the 1st Afterlight, using it over any other photo editing apps. That being said, the newest version of Afterlight is very much the same except for the new \u201cFusion\u201d and \u201cDouble exposure\u201d features. While the features are nice and provide an additional touch to your editing they aren\u2019t enough for me to justify the cost to get this newer version of Afterlight. In my opinion, if you already have the 1st version of Afterlight then you don\u2019t have a need for Afterlight 2. Afterlight 2 does have an updated look and layout which is extremely appealing and easy to use. Overall it is the same app minus a few newly added features, which I feel shouldn\u2019t have been a qualification for a new app and should have been an update to the original Afterlight. FINAL THOUGHTS, I am an avid user of photo editing applications so I would absolutely purchase Afterlight 2 again due to the overall experience and quality of the app. Afterlight is in my opinion the best photo editing application available for your smart devices!</p>|I have used various photo editing applications including VSCO, MuseCam, Darkroom, and Mextures and Afterlight is the only one that has kept me coming back. I have used Afterlight for years, ever since it\u2019s initial release and have purchased every single in-app filter pack available, including the borders and other effects in the first application. When I found out about Afterlights successor application release, I immediately purchased it and did not regret it. I also adore the fact that the developers made it clear that once you purchase the second, there are no more in-app purchases thereafter. Even if there were, I\u2019d be the first to buy them. The application is quality, and the filters are good. I work as a professional digital artist and would love to create a set of filters for Afterlight. I\u2019ve tried contacting the devs via email and Twitter to no avail. Oh well, I still admire the application and the hard work put into it. This will always be my #1 go to application.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 76%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.5, 1.8K Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#2 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "35.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/fat-cigar-productions-ltd/id555490896?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!Our leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby\u2019s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. 'I found it in a nano second. It is very very quick to pick it up' Charlotte Hall, 36wCategory #1 in the USA and 71 other countries. Here's why...Developed by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's heartbeat and other sounds - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.'Found him or her very quickly very easy to find :)' - Katie, 26w**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****Yes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's sounds and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.It may take time to find, and depends on the position of your baby so you'll need to stick with it and be patient. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 30-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. We constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.We want you to be happy with HMB and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!GIFT THIS APP: Click the \u201cBuy App\u201d arrow on the iTunes\u00ae App StoreFAQs**** No Accessories Required ****We use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your baby heartbeat.**** Works Beautifully From 27 Weeks ****It is possible (but less likely) to hear from as early as 16-20 weeks, best results are most often achieved as the baby gets larger.**** How It Works ****1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. 2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment5. Take a selfie if you wish and share 6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best results**** Easy Share Feature ****Sharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.**** We Care About Your Privacy ****We take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.**** Before you start... ****You DO need to follow the instructions for HMB to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive in the heartbeat range.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other sounds :) Please Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.**** Supported Phones ****X, Xs, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s &amp; 5.

This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****No - we wouldn't wish to claim otherwise. Under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong with your baby :)- Consult your doctor for any advice.

Hell even the BPM was at 156 ( typical baby heart rate)  When i finally went into the Dr she discovered i did have a gestational sac but a baby never formed so I never had a forming baby! This app manipulates a babys heartbeat! I actually posted a recording of what ive been hearing for weeks on the facebook group, check it out!!! Sounds just like a babys heartbeat except there\u2019s absolutely no baby, another mom used it when she wasn't even pregnant and she found a babys heartbeat another mom as taken tests, all are negative results but she also has found a babys heartbeat, its sad how we moms are getting false a manipulating sounds !!!Please MOMS do not use this app for peace of mind or  for reassurance! If you are having an issue don\u2019t hesitate for one second to see your provider or the nearest ER! DO NOT TRUST THIS APP OR ANY APP when it comes to your pregnancy or your health! Trust medical testing, see your provider! Be excited for your pregnancy and excited about your visits to see your baby on ultrasound and a medical doppler! Best of luck to all you mommys and your sweet babies!!!</p>|I was skeptical to even download this app. I really didn\u2019t believe an app on a phone could pick up my babies heart beat. With a recent scare resulting in a hospital visit, I figured it was worth a shot for peace of mind. I downloaded the app, got nice and comfy in a quiet room, followed all of the instructions, and could not find my baby. I found my own heartbeat fairly quick. I read tips and realized my anterior placenta may be an issue. I was incredibly upset and asked for a refund. Support was very kind and sent instructions on a refund (which I never did). Well today I figured why not try again, AND I FOUND HER! It took a few tries in different spots, and she kicked the whole time making it a little harder, but I got a very clear recording of her and even recorded my own for comparison! I am so happy I gave this a shot and tried as many times as I did! Don\u2019t give up! I am 27 weeks with an anterior placenta, and I found the heartbeat with this!</p>|I am exactly 12 weeks (3 mos.) I have my doctors appt in 2 days and I haven\u2019t been feeling well for the past 2 days. I saw the add on IG a few days ago and read the reviews over and over. My husband also came across the app and asked if we should try it! Considering that I am only 12 weeks I was not too sure if it would work. I decided to spend the $4.99 and give it a try! I first try it on my own heart and then my husbands and it picked them up quick.. okay now let\u2019s see if it works to find my sweet baby\u2019s heartbeat! This was going to be my first time hearing it... well after trying for about 5 mins on my left side of my stomach, I tried it next on the right... we heard something! As I continued to try... the heart beat was there!!!! MY HEART WAS FULL OF JOY!!! I could actually hear the strong heart beat of my sweet baby!! I cannot wait to have my boys listen to the heart beat tomorrow!!  Best $5 spent!

I absolutely love every feature in this game, and would say the physics, graphics, and scaling couldn\u2019t have been made better. Now what I really would like to suggest as a realistic improvement for the game is the ability to have a free moving camera for watching and recording replays, as simply watching from the basic camera angle doesn\u2019t necessarily capture enough and I feel that it limits the games replay and recording feature. Another suggestion would be possible multiplayer, but I do realize how much work that does take and maybe it\u2019s a bit out of the picture. With that being said, if it could be done I feel that it would add a whole new interesting element to the game that could attract many more players, and capture the current player base to possibly buy more in game purchases such as parks as they could be having fun with friends. Other than that thank you for such an awesome game!</p>|True skate is a very fun, easy to learn mobile skating game, I would recommend this game to any skater that can\u2019t find a good skating game for mobile. I think this game is worth the price except for two thing. One, you can play this game for a while but after a week or two of playing a lot, you get bored of the starting map but you are forced to pay more money for a game that already costed you money, although all the extra maps are good, you have to pay for something in game even though you already payed for the game, which is very annoying. Two, unless this is just me, or it\u2019s an actual bug for everyone, or this is something that the developers added to the game purposefully for some reason, I honk it needs to be fixed ASAP. Every time that I crash or something like that, my board basically stops working and starts being very hard to move around and do tricks with and starts being very floppy, every time I move it starts bumping up and down like something is there, and it is very annoying and I restart my game every time it starts because it is basically impossible to do a trick successfully. Apart from these two things though, this game is very fun</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 54%;", "one_star": "width: 19%;", "star": "3.8, 2K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#2 in Sports"}, {"size": "126.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/505-games-us-inc/id392990484?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "DIG!

Overall, a pretty good port, sporting the 1.2 update from the PC. The game looks great, controls... aren\u2019t the best but useable, and the tutorial is a relatively good place to start off from, and does a good job at explaining the first part of the game, one thing the PC edition doesn\u2019t have. I have a couple gripes with the game though. First, the inventory and crafting interfaces look overcrowded and can be pretty overwhelming for example when you aren\u2019t familiar with the game. Organizing your inventory is pretty tedious, and definitely needs a redesign. Another thing, is that on phones, you only have 5 hot bar slots, and the game is zoomed in so much that you can only see about 10-15 tiles or so in front of you, and your hearts are super tiny. However, when playing on iPad, you get 10 hot-bar slots and a much more zoomed-out view of the world, somewhere around 40 blocks around you, which makes for a much better gaming experience, and because of the bigger screen, inventory managing is slightly easier, but same problems as the phone. Anyway, that\u2019s about it on my opinion of the game, and I would say definitely pick up a copy if you have five bucks lying around. Hoping the devs fix these issues with the next update. Thanks for reading, have a good one. \u270c\ufe0f</p>|I would give this game four stars because all of the things I think need fixed will probably be fixed later on. There is one thing I am kinda freaking mad about right now. The auto save every two minutes. It seems nice, but I have such bad issue and had so many problems. So I'll be playing normally like a happy camper and the wham it crashes. I'm all right with crashes, and that's not the problem . The problem is when I get back all of my progress from the last auto save is gone. Now most of the time it's all right but recently nearly the worst thing happened. My inventory was getting full and I was building. I made a chest to store my stuff in. I used the button to put all of my inventory in the chest. When I closed the chest the game crashed. I came back and all my stuff was not in my inventory so I thought I was fine. I walk to the chest, but there's only one problem. It's not freaking there! So I have none of my stuff except for my hot bar, ammo, and money. I don't even now all I lost. But if you think about it it doesn't make sense. How could all my stuff be gone which happened after I made the chests. The chests were gone though. What I'm trying to say is if it took the chests and my stuff why didn't it give it back. I don't know if it makes sense. I hope the creators of terraria will read this and fix my problem, and any others who have the same.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 77%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.5, 26.5K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#4 in Adventure"}, {"size": "50.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/scott-cawthon/id777236428?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "This is the official mobile port of Five Nights at Freddys!NOTE: This game requires at least 512 megs of ram to run properly; low-memory devices such as the iPod gen 3 and 4 will crash during gameplay.

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights!

People say that there are bugs of the door and the light not working and that\u2019s part of the game idiots they jammed the door. When I got my 15$ AppStore/iTunes gift card this was the first thing I got. I\u2019ve knew fnaf for years and I finally get to play it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this game but I\u2019m stuck on night 6!!! It\u2019s either someone Jammed the door and I can\u2019t flip the camera and either golden Freddy will pop up then I have to be forced to flip the camera so if he pops up your pretty much dead unless your really low on power then it will cut out or I have to keep the left door closed because foxy and then I run out of power ._. And sometimes Freddy even jumpscares me. It\u2019s so annoying I just wanna get it done with so I can move on to the second game. And there\u2019s a bug you need to fix and it\u2019s the screen when I flip my screen it doesn\u2019t work but when I\u2019m off fnaf my screen works idk if this is a coincidence or it\u2019s a game bug if it is plz fix it.-A person who really likes fnaf and even sneaked his phone to class to play this and got away with it.Jk they let me play with it because I tricked them by saying it\u2019s a game where you have to flash lights close doors and there\u2019s a Fox bear bunny and bird I know their names but I didn\u2019t tell them and they believed me. That was at recess I\u2019m 4th grade</p>|The game was running great and being the amazing game it is (now I know this doesn't matter very much but the only thing going wrong until night 3 was the poster in my office. Isn't it supposed to make a noise when you click it? It didn't work 75% of the time for me) until I reached night 3. Whenever Chica was outside my right door in the hallway, it wouldn't let me close it. This made me lose night 3 many times until it started working again. I hoped it was the end of it, but it did it again when I reached night 4. When I reached night 5, it was no longer on and off (inconsistent) but CONSTANT. It is keeping me from winning the game and it very annoying! It is especially annoying since I am a YouTuber and was trying to record my play through while this was happening. It is embarrassing to experience a glitch like that in front of my viewers, especially since it was keeping me from winning. Also, I'm not sure if this is supposed to happen but my cameras often black out for about 4-8 seconds every now and then which has also cost me a win many times. I hate to say this but if this keeps happening I won't be playing your games anymore. Please fix this!</p>|I absolutely love this game. I love how the series has gone up and above with not only its method of story telling, but how it\u2019s really in touch with the fan base and has delivered a great game after each one in the series. You could tell that I got really excited when I saw almost all of the games on the App Store lol. However I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend the Apps to play the games rather than the computer. These games are meant for FNAF fans who are not at a computer at the given moment, and while that\u2019s a good concept the mechanics make it hard to play as well as the game consisting of a lot of bugs. In Night 4 when defending against Foxy (where you check the cameras and when you see him running all the way to the door), the battery goes down 10%-15% in less than a second, making the 4th night nearly impossible. Idk if this is just me but I reinstalled the app and it always happens on night 4 and nowhere else, so if Scott could fix his game then that would be greatly appreciated.

I agree with the other review about the holiday clothes glitching up a bit. The bunny hat for Easter specifically is what tipped me off, while in Easter I got a lower score for wearing the bunny ears than for wearing another Easter colored hat, which makes no sense. Also, when customizing a male character, you have access to all the hairstyles (male and female), but you only have access to the longer styles while customizing a female, really don\u2019t understand this. On the other side of that, thank you for finally letting male characters wear skirts!! I love that change, realized it totally by accident. Last thing, in the mobile version here, doing the final toppings on a three cookie plate is difficult because you can\u2019t get the cherry fully on the left scoop or fully on the right because the slider doesn\u2019t go far enough over. Something I\u2019m learning to work with but still a bit frustrating. Thank you guys for this game, I am loving it!!!</p>|I\u2019ve been playing Flipline\u2019s Papa Louie\u2019s games ever since middle school and I have to say, this newest installment of their game is the best yet!I\u2019ve played most of their games on the computer, but when I heard about these \u201cTo Go!\u201d versions, I started downloading them immediately! They were just as fun as they were on the computer and the new controls for mobile devices were seamlessly created to make it similar to those online! My only criticism of the older To Go! games is that their graphics were not very sharp, but it is understandable. However, the developers have incredibly improved Papa Louie\u2019s Scooperia To Go! The biggest change I\u2019ve found is a complete overhaul of the displays for each page. The controls are very similar to those on the computer and are friendly to whoever is playing the game. Furthermore, the graphics are very sharp, and cleaner than ever. Overall, Papa\u2019s games are fun to play for everyone. I\u2019m 20 and I still play these games religiously! If you haven\u2019t played them yet, this app is very worth the $1.99! Keep up the awesome work Flipline!!!</p>|In the past I\u2019ve downloaded Flipline\u2019s games onto my iPad because there are more features and higher quality in the HD versions. I was hesitant to get the \u201cTo Go\u201d version of Papa\u2019s Scooperia, but I must say that it is AMAZING! The graphic quality is stellar and the content is worth every penny! There is so much to unlock and to buy that you\u2019ll never get bored of playing!!Update: So far all of the fixes have been great! Thanks for adding the speed meter in the dough station! I think it would be really awesome if there was an option to purchase a dough speed upgrade in the shop that allowed you to scoop faster.

However, it\u2019s also a super easy way to waste time you don\u2019t even realize you could be using on other things. I use Forest mostly in small increments, and it keeps me from picking up my phone whenever I have a few free minutes and get bored. Since I don\u2019t actually need or want to be on my phone, the small motivation of growing little bushes and trees is enough for me to direct my attention elsewhere- and it turns out that those few free minutes throughout the day can translate into a lot of extra productivity!Otherwise: initial download price might seem a bit high, but considering that they plant real trees if you make enough coins to buy the option, the $2 is warranted. Coin prices in the app are average, but payment per tree during the week is okay and you can make enough yourself with a little effort (I personally think you should make a little more per tree than they offer, but it\u2019s not a bad amount either). The interface is simple and intuitive, the art is charming and stylistically uniform, and my favorite part- the white noise options- are incredibly helpful for studying and neither overly expensive or so complicated that they become distracting.All in all, great app that I use frequently. $2 has never bought me so much extra productivity.</p>|I downloaded the app for work productivity, but it\u2019s made me hyper-aware of how often I actually pick up my phone. For any task, just having the reminder that my phone is not currently available to me is extremely helpful. I\u2019m realizing that I waste a ton of time that stems from, say, just looking at a text that could wait until later. Moral: don\u2019t think this app isn\u2019t useful because you\u2019re not at a desk all day. It has countless uses. I agree with what other users have said about gamification being a good motivator, and the user interface is very appealing. Creating and naming tags produces helpful data. For instance, if you\u2019re concerned about work-life balance, you can see a colorful pie chart with a few simple clicks. One thing: I\u2019m fine with how the trees become more \u201cexpensive\u201d as time passes. However, it can take a long, long time to gain sufficient coins after awhile. I\u2019m not asking for instant and easy gratification, because that\u2019s contrary to the spirit of the app. I think adding more achievement bonuses (that don\u2019t depend on having friends that use the app or on leaderboard performance) would be great. Unlocking achievements is also rewarding and something to strive for, so I\u2019d love to see more!</p>|The cute little trees are just so adorable that I start wanting to put down my phone so I can unlock new ones! I am eagerly awaiting new trees to be added. The user interface is very simple and aesthetic. All in all it\u2019s a great app; the only problem is that sometimes I run into situations where I plant a tree but then end up needing to use my phone for something (like if my mom calls or I have to look up something for homework) and can\u2019t wait for the tree to finish. There is a feature where you can have the app continue counting time after the tree finshes growing, so you can work around the problem by planting a short-time tree and then just continuing to not disturb it. But it would be really great if there was some sort of pause feature, maybe with some limitation like not earning coins if you pause it so that people don\u2019t take advantage of it to \u2018cheat\u2019 on their time. Or maybe something where you can erase or reset the time, so you don\u2019t have to feel bad about killing a cute little tree when you actually legitimately needed to use your phone for a minute.</p>", "four_star": "width: 7%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 89%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.8, 4.5K Ratings", "category": "Productivity", "sub_rank": "#1 in Productivity"}, {"size": "52.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 8%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/yu-bo/id583555215?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Now, you can DRAW movies, AND you can draw ON movies!

I\u2019ve been able to make a lot of little edits for friends, family, and instagram! The app itself is pretty easy to use and has great pre-made transitions too. Sometimes there will be a few glitches, but it happens rarely and/or you\u2019re just doing weird transitions that take up a lot of space. This is avoidable tho, so I\u2019ve been okay so far. But if you could try to fix this problem it would be even better! But I do wish there was a few more things in the app to make editing easier. Like the mirror effect, There\u2019s other apps I can make it on but it would be soooo much better if it was in the app. Another thing I wish it would have is shakes and bounces, It\u2019s really hard to do them right now and never turns out the way I want it to. At times just trying to do shakes takes an hour or two, super annoying. You could add shakes and bounces to pre-made transitions! It would mean everything to me if they did this. Over all, the app is great but it does have some minor bugs or crashes. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t turn out as smooth as it should. But a big thing would be adding the shakes and other stuff I mentioned above. I do recommend buying this app tho!!</p>|I love this app sm! I\u2019ve been editing on it for about 2 years and it\u2019s been great. Although, it needs bigger updates. Y\u2019all need to add a lot more stuff if you want to become bigger. This app is great but there are a lot of annoying glitches and things that the app can\u2019t do but shouldn\u2019t. First of all, you guys need to add a \u201cmirror clips\u201d (or \u201cmotion tile\u201d on After Effects) option along with an option to have it reflected or not. This app should also feature more transitions, the preset transitions already on the app are old and almost no one uses them. I would love to see actual and cool bounce/shake transitions! Stuff like on After Effects. Also, it has a ton of glitches but I wouldn\u2019t mind them if you added the stuff I suggested above. If you guys were to follow my suggestions and become more like After Effects, a lot more people would use your app \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Just sayin\u2019. If you add more BIG stuff to your updates, I wouldn\u2019t have bought AE to try to become better at editing. I know that phone editing programs have their limits but I think that you guys can honestly do it. Anyways, love the app, and it\u2019s so good but you need to do more with it. You\u2019re basically throwing away a perfectly good fixable app.</p>|I\u2019ve been using cute cut for almost a year now, maybe even close to two and I\u2019ve always loved it and found it quite easy to use! However, I\u2019ve recently come across some things that annoy me, such as: glitches. I\u2019ve never made an edit that hasn\u2019t had at least one glitch in it, and recently I\u2019ve had to remake projects because the app simply wouldn\u2019t allow me to open my edit without crashing. Your effects also need updating. Sure, it\u2019s great that we have the custom transition, and it does allow for many of the transitions we see on ae and vs, but a lot of the time you have to use other apps to get there, where as you can simply get those transitions directly from the app itself or somebody who has turned it into a file you can scan into the app on ae and vs. we need to be able to import colorings, transitions and other things from other editors that use cute cut! Colorings are also an issue, as there a very few that you can make and often you can\u2019t even tell you\u2019ve added coloring to your edit. There should be more options for that, as well as audio and video quality. Other than these things though, the app has been amazing and I love it :)</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 65%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.3, 3.4K Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#4 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "1.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bytes-inc/id451040503?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "With this app, you can add effects like a cross filter to attach to the camera lens.

The KiraKira+ app has about 12 sparkle settings and a bar to adjust the shine. The Brillar App ONLY has 1 setting and 3 levels of sparkle. Even the lowest setting looks overly sparkly and fake. The sparkles are too big and look almost cartoonish. It might be better if you\u2019re using it in a larger item, I used it on a bedazzled makeup brush.

All to make a quick buck.  Myself, like many other user-patrons, have long ago paid for premium services or to have ads removed.  And then suddenly out rolls the latest update with its Subscription based services and all of those previous payments are negated. Now we have to pay again, and usually considerably more money for many of the features that we already paid for. Is this not fraud? Bait and Switch? False advertising? It wouldn't surprise me to see this eventually unfold into a class action lawsuit. Apple could be complicit as well for allowing it. I could be mistaken as I am not a lawyer, but even if what they are doing is legal, it still seems unethical and bad business. Come on Developers! Do the right thing! You had a fantastic app here with a base of users who would gladly pay for your next great app. Lose the subscription, give us back the original Glitch and roll out Glitch2. Make it bigger and better. You will have a lot of happy customers instead of ex-customers. I for one will applaud your efforts and gladly pay for another app; even for a Subscription.</p>|I was very disappointed to see that once I paid for the app, to unlock full-access, I would have to pay $9 more. It would be helpful if Glitch\u00e9 would make it implicit to their customers that this app will not permit full use of the filters when attempting to take a photo/video, and that this will only be used as an editing tool for photos/pictures in the iPhone photo library. I'm also not sure why I have to pay $2.99 to access \"HD export\" which, in all honesty, Glitch\u00e9 is charging me to use the full quality of the camera that is built into my phone. I already paid for the app, and an extra $2.99 for camera filter use. Why would the app block/downscale features that are native to my iPhone 7 Plus (such as HD picture/video quality)? It also charges extra to use the filters for videos in the camera roll. I'm a bit upset that I feel like I've been lied to by the app's developers in order for them to make a quick buck.</p>|I discovered this app a while ago but didn't know if it was worth purchasing. After seeing that so many pictures I loved on Instagram were edited with this app, I decided to install it. After paying 0,99$, the app enables many editing features for the pictures in your camera roll but you need to pay extra in order to edit videos. After turning my picture into a little masterpiece, I saved it in my camera roll only to realize the quality downgraded A LOT. I thought it was a bug but saw that you need to pay 2,99$ to save the pictures in high resolution. I'm very disappointed with this app. It had so much potential and it should warn everyone that you need to pay a lot more if you want everything unlocked. I wish I could give it 3 and a half stars because it is still a very cool editing app but the fact that I have to pay extra for the quality of the final pic is simply outrageous.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 63%;", "one_star": "width: 21%;", "star": "3.9, 2.9K Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#13 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "104.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mehrdad-mehrain/id536049511?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "\u25cf 24hr SALE!

A few bugs like organizing my workouts throws them all out of whack $m&amp; a few minor bugs (v3.1). It was the first &amp; best of it's kind, but seems to have trouble now adding features other average workout tracker apps have &amp; keeping up with the technology. I want to see you guys back at #1!PAST REVIEW:\"Started working out about a month ago, &amp; have had an old version of iFitness on my phone for years, which I have been using to track my workouts. Downloaded this Full Fitness app which is exactly the same UI, but much better because they still update it, unlike iFitness which is no longer in service. They let me import all my logs from this month from iFitness &amp; even my custom exercises (&amp; the pictures I saved for the machines I added). This is an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE for anybody that uses the gym, whether to body build or just lose some weight!!! Thank you guys.\"  -D.A.</p>|I among most, if not all, of the loyal Full Fitness app users were undoubtedly frustrated and turned off by the long awaited rollout of the apps version 3.0 that came out in November 2016. The app got a nice facelift but the usability of it took a nose dive and it was very hard to navigate workout history, review most recent information and even having to enter all the info for a set for each and every set was frustrating. Well it looks like the developers received plenty of feedback from it (I myself wrote a somewhat lengthy review of it) and version 3.1 is in!  I took it for a quick test drive this morning before work and everything I asked for to be corrected has been. The workout history is in chronological order, the most recent lifts are on the log entry page and your weight and rep input stays in for easy re-entry. I can't wait to get back in that gym for a full workout and have my trusted, beloved and easy to use app back. Thank you to the developers for quickly correcting these major issue for the users.</p>|This is a straightforward, no frills app.  Other popular apps I looked at all want to charge you a recurring yearly fee fo their premium features.  I don\u2019t need a million diet plans.  This is a one time fee that allows you to make as many workout plans as you wish.  Occasionally I find an exercise that isn\u2019t in their database, but I always find something similar and I just remember to substitute it.  The only change i would recommend is to label the workout history.  You can see what exercises you have previously done, but I have five i cycle between and if I have taken a couple of rest days I sometimes forget where I left off.  It doesn\u2019t say \u201cworkout A\u201d or whatever I have named it.  You just have to look and figure out what you were doing.  Overall I hope they keep doing updates and keep this app active.</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 69%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.4, 3.8K Ratings", "category": "Health & Fitness", "sub_rank": "#1 in Health & Fitness"}, {"size": "1.5 GB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/lime-turtle-inc/id1254864643?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Catch, evolve and collect over 300 unique Nexomon!Assemble the ultimate Nexomon team to save your friends and save the world!

Nexomon, while having a lot of similarities to Pok\u00e9mon, feels like something unique. Something special. I spent pretty much most of my free time playing this instead of actually gaming systems. It was actually something that pulled me in so much that I spent a couple nights where I only got about 3 hours of sleep before work. If you\u2019re looking for something to remind you of the good ol Pok\u00e9mon days, or even just a good game for younger kids that haven\u2019t jumped into similar games yet, this is an amazing choice. The humor is spot on, they have amazing references to other pop culture things, and the game is very self aware it\u2019s a game. The story is actually pretty nice and engaging as well. There are only a handful of faults that I can find, and most of that has to do with the cash shop in a paid game. Nothing in there is needed, so you can ignore it, but it is annoying because you will have two big buttons on the top right hand side the whole time you\u2019re playing. These buttons take a lot of space and are only there to make sure you\u2019re aware there is a cash shop. The game is so good that you\u2019ll forget they are there for most of your play time, but when you notice it, it\u2019ll get under your skin. The game is so good that I would honestly just pay for a full $20 release.</p>|A refreshing monster-collecting and battling RPG adventure. The storyline is enchanting and the characters are well designed and likable. The designs of the Nexomons are original and the animations are very smooth. The game isn\u2019t P2W (pay to win) which is really nice. The extra purchase options will make the game easier, faster, or adds more customization options, but they\u2019re not necessary at all to complete the game. The soundtrack is rather beautiful: relaxing at times and intense when appropriate. The creators and the team did a great job at developing this game and creating this universe. I only have a small issue with the game, and that is with the battle system. The statistics of the monsters isn\u2019t well explained. Battling is very fluid for beginners to this genre of games, but could be very awkward for more advanced players. Most monsters don\u2019t have very diverse strengths in stats with others of the same rarity level. Abilities/moves also don\u2019t have an adequate description. You only know the energy costs for the moves, but the game doesn\u2019t provide its Power or Accuracy. Also, status inflicting moves have a ridiculously low percent of landing. If the developers can change up the battling mechanics, this game would be perfect.</p>|I love this game I have micromon as well I'm a fan of this game creator I really like the art style of the game I love all the Nexomon and the game itself I do have a few suggestions to make the game like 1000% better ok here it is more Nexomon that can follow you like say shashock for example;) and dialogue options for the player character rather than atlas speaking for your character I find the hand holding in games is just far to much I also Heard that there is going to be story expansions that I am extremely excited for to be honest if you just slowly add more and more to the game it would be perfect just keep it going I mean even if I had to pay for each expansion or whatever I like this game so much I would iv already got everything in the other part of gem shop except repeal and iv got one avatar and one pet aka the Nexomon followers just want a fewLittle extra things ya know not much By the way I want to personally thank the creators of this app it is absolutely awesome I adore it so thank you Nexomon creators I absolutely appreciate the time and effort put into this game it brightens my days up I can't wait to see what else you come up with in the expansions \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 86%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.7, 2.9K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#2 in Role Playing"}, {"size": "129.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 7%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/toca-boca-ab/id419103351?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Welcome to Toca Hair Salon 3!

Although, I do find some imperfections within the app. When using the \"Blend\" feature (after I have merged two photos) I attempt to erase the overlying image, only to find that the erased outline doesn't come out as precise as I would like. Maybe this could be improved upon by adding a zoomed-in, magnifying window to this Blend feature? Another few drawbacks that I have noticed: the brushes are sometimes not small enough to receive \"detailed\" precision (but this can also be due to a lack of an increased zoom.. which should be updated to zoom as close as we would like. Also, when the magnifying glass appears when I'm attempting to whiten teeth (among other edits), the magnifying glass will not show any changes that I make in real-time, making it hard for me to see what I'm actually changing in the picture (as my thumb is in the way)--&gt; please update these features? Preciseness is the only aspect of the app that I would wish to be improved upon. LightX has set a new engineering standard for all photo apps! That being said, I have deleted every other photo editing tool on my phone (save for my stock camera app). Keep up the hard work!</p>|Honestly, I never pay for apps. I was hesitant in buying an app, but it was so worth it. This app is great. I can do everything. There are a few bugs though (under splash, the first time using erase or draw makes a streak on the picture)(using magic eraser sometimes takes the brush off of sharp points in pictures). Other than that, it\u2019s amazing.I just wish under splash there was a \u201cpick color from picture\u201d option, like for \u201cdoodle\u201d in another app \u201cPixlr\u201d (the button looks like a dropper). Also, I\u2019d like to be able to color over black. I usually make black items lighter and then color them in, but I\u2019d love to just color over it and skip a step. Keep up the good work!</p>|I love this app! It has so many features, and new ones are added throughout the year. Once you learn what each feature does, you can create some really cool images.

Great info and user interface. Was able to quickly keep pace with my draft and get rankings and info on the players. One slight problem. The app was able to import my league with positions and scoring from MFL. However, my league is a bit custom and we do special teams instead of kickers. The app did not recognize the position of special teams so it did not offer any info for it. Since our league is custom in this position I didn\u2019t expect the app to support it. However, in the past I have used the kicker position as a stand in or best estimate of the special teams position. The app didn\u2019t let me modify the imported settings to do that. That would have got you 5 stars.</p>|Last year I used this app to do lots of mocks for all my different leagues.  Then I took it to Vegas and used it during my live FFPC drafts.  Made my live drafts so easy because I had used the same thing to mock.  I had my personalized adp and draft strategy saved on the app and as the draft progressed, Draft Dominator updated on the fly reacting to how the other teams were drafting.  This year\u2019s version includes support for Best Ball and Auction Leagues as well.  It\u2019s very powerful and customizable - the more you put into setting it up the more you get out of the app.  I can\u2019t recommend it enough, go get it !!!</p>|I have been using this app every year since it was an excel app. We have a draft that has maxes at positions and then opens up to free agents at round 15. I went to change the max settings and then it said do you want to reset the draft after making changes. Who would want to do this? Obviously they hired people who don't play FFL to program this years version. Also, cheat sheet thought positions were maxed and had a red x and took the position players off the board even though maxes were not hit. Main reason I paid for this app in the past was that it calculated that other teams would not be going after players because they hit their maxes or the other teams would be going after other positions.

While using the app to look at the sky, I can choose how I want the constellations to appear, but once I tap on the constellation, the picture appears and obstructs my view. I like seeing the picture, and I love that the app includes information about the mythological person/beast, but I don\u2019t like that the picture obstructs my view of the constellation and all that appears in it. So once I\u2019ve seen the picture, I would like to turn it off. What I really want to see when I tap on a constellation is the boarder lines of the constellation. I.e., I want to see the region of space bordered by the constellation.Here is my reply to the developers response. I appreciate your response, but it looks like you misunderstood my suggestion. I know how to change the settings of the constellations. I mentioned this in my review, and I have my constellations set to appear with the lines connecting the stars. However, when I tap the constellation the picture still appears. This is the part I don\u2019t like and can\u2019t change.</p>|The app is designed very well, with options to change how the constellations appear (lines or actual pictures) and how many stars are visible in the sky. The music is also very nice. You do have to download packs to get information on satellites, the cores of planets, etc. but it is well worth it. The app never lags, which is fantastic, because if you are like me you get the urge to smash furniture when apps are slow. My one complaint (if you can even call it that) is that not every star has its own information. Many of the stars, when you click on their info tab, simply give the definition of a star. I understand that this is because many stars do not have much information known about them, but at the same time I\u2019d rather not be able to recite the \u201ca star is a luminous sphere of plasma...\u201d spiel in my sleep.

This is amazing if you want to capture wind, blur moving people out of public spaces, or just make motion look smooth. The latest version appears to have resolved one of my two major complaints about the app: it used to have problems with smooth exposure ramping in slow shutter mode, causing big exposure jumps when shooting a sunrise for example... it appears that has been resolved in my last few shoots, and I imagine (although I haven\u2019t tried it yet) that I could do a beautiful night-to-day timelapse with it and have it come out seamless. (The other complaint was how if the phone runs out of battery during a timelapse the whole video is lost, I haven\u2019t looked into that yet.)Thank you so much to the developer for making this, it has turned an old iPhone I no longer use into my favorite timelapse camera. Cheers!</p>|I have been using NightCap Camera app for more than a year, primarily in long exposure mode. I use it mostly for imaging nebula with my telescope and a night vision device, but I have also captured galaxies and many open and globular clusters.  I can positively say that without NightCap and my night vision device, my efforts would be fruitless. I especially appreciate that NightCap will average photos for a period of time which is user set; this eliminates almost all noise that would otherwise be present in the image.  You can see one or more of my images in the NightCap gallery... astrophotography with a phone!   I give NightCap my highest recommendation.</p>|I was a bit skeptical about how well this app would work but after a few days I am really impressed. I have yet to try the night sky due to weather and the full moon but I have used it to take portraits by candle light. Something the native camera app cannot do. I only gave it four stars because you MUST either prop the phone up or use a tripod of some kind to hold it still. I would like to see an image alignment function to reposition each frame taken with the first one so one can hand hold in some of these modes.

I bought it to try and consolidate all the functions I need in to one app. Initially I found the tuner very jumpy, and I don't like the smiley face with concentric half circles tuning model at all, so I wrote a pretty harsh review.  The developer contacted me and pointed out the string tuning mode, which I initially couldn't find because it's not in the tuning section; it's under the sound tab. It makes it much easier to tune my guitar (and it has setting for many stringed instruments from viola to banjo) but if I try to sing long tones or play them on my trumpet, I'm back in the happy face tuner.  In theory it should work but to me, the slightest pitch change in a long tone causes the rings to jump erratically.  I think that the string mode rescued the app from deletion, and added one star to my rating, but I will still sing and play long tones into the free \"pano tuner\" rather than deal with the unhappy happy faces.  Kudos to the developer for helping me find my way around the app. One more quick gripe, if I'm singing with the metronome playing, the app hears the click and reacts to it, so you essentially can't tune with the metronome on.</p>|I compared the tuner function against multiple korg model timers and found this app to be all over the map with the tuning. Some notes that were in tune on the korg tuners were showing 15 cents flat or sharp!!  That is a problem with the app. How can you have a \u201ctuning\u201d app out of tune?  I\u2019ll be sticking with the korg. BTW they were both set at 440UPDATE:  I revised my original rating from 2 stars to 5.

Plus extra. The person complaining about not being able to charge for admission hasn't played through all the scenarios. There's levels where you can charge admission and not for rides etc... There is no free form park so that's different. Also if you did some research about etc you'd  find the tricks. The quickest way make money in any scenario is an old cheat that was on the computer version and it works on the phone and iPad too. You make the park admission price free, then for every ride you set the admission price to the excitement rating. so test rides before opening so you can set the price. Oh and you always round down to the nearest 10, so if the ride has an excitement rating of 7.87 (roller coasters are higher) you can charge $7.80 for it. If you do that, guests always ride your rides and most think it's a good value. Then you have tons of people running out of cash. When your value is dropping make sure you assign handymen to sweep their own section rather then placing a bunch randomly. Then make sure the park loops around so people can find the exit after they've gone through everything. You can even set all the guests who are saying \"I wanna go home\" over by the exit and they will leave and the value goes up.</p>|So I used to play this game years ago on PC. I would always check the app store a lot to see if I could find something as close to this game as possible to play but it always ended in bad copy cat versions. I gave up looking for a while and then my sister texted me telling me to buy this app and try it. She said she had already bought it and it was amazing. I was immediately excited to give it a try myself so I bought it ASAP. Let me tell you this is the best thing I\u2019ve ever purchased in the app store. It is THE EXACT SAME GAME as it was for PC. The only difference ive noticed is that in some maps you can charge for park fee and not for rides, in others you can only charge for rides and not entrance fees. Honestly this made it funner for me because it was more of a challenge. They also included new features that make it easier to play (such as the \u2018mark all as same price\u2019 feature so you dont have to constantly change the price of ever food stand you make). Im telling you right now if you liked the PC version have no doubts and buy this app. Not even joking everyone in my household had bought this on their IPads and weve all been addicted the last couple days.</p>|I can\u2019t say there is anything I regret about purchasing this near-flawless rendition, so 5 stars is a given. However, please update the hide scenery button and underground view functions and all of those checkboxes next to it, to be user enabled permanently on each map. It is beyond frustrating to try and rapidly deploy rides on a map like fungus woods, when the trees \u201cre-sprout\u201d as soon as I lay the foundation for a pre-built ride(then you have to \u201copt + hide scene\u201d again and again and again and again, to lay entrances, paths, etc., and it becomes frustrating beyond words). Same goes for working on underground maps, which become unbearable. If you just make it so that I check the hide scenery box once to hide the trees while I build, and they remain hidden until I uncheck the box to view them again, the gameplay would improve drastically, same goes for the other checkbox functions. Also I remember getting notifications with how many people died on crashed rides in the original pc version, so please bring that back.

It is my main simulator. For those say that the $5 is a demo, this is a lot more than a demo. You get around 8 aircraft with lots of detail and accurate physics. No other mobile flight sim comes with that many aircraft. This sim also contains stunning graphics no matter where you fly. If you buy the pro subscription, you get a whole lot more. You get nearly 40 aircraft, access to all new features in updates, global flight, and 3 multiplayer servers for each skill level. The live experience is amazing once you get used to it. You get a lot of detailed planes and thousands of worldwide airports. For those complaining about the price: I have done calculations (probably inaccurate), and this game probably costs over $3 million to operate. This sim is how it\u2019s developers make money. Paying the 12 developers is expensive. Next, the 3 huge servers are very expensive. The satellite imagery costs nearly a million dollars. Aircraft research, the community, and other costs are thousands of dollars. Also, the yearly subscription isn\u2019t the only option. It cost just $10 to get all these features for a month. Try it out and see how good it is. If you want to continue, buy the subscription for a longer period of time, and you will get a discount. Overall, this is a great app, and I thank the developers for all their effort that they put into this app. I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading.</p>|This is a wonderful flight simulator, and I see that a lot of people are complaining about having to pay for extra features. Those who are, please read. For five dollars you are getting an amazing mobile flight simulator with over a dozen planes with liveries of actual companies and airliners. A lot of real life physics including wind, turbulence, day/night, g force, weight, and much, much more. You get to explore miles and miles of different regions around the world. There is no other mobile flight simulator with these features with that low of a price. Look at Aerofly FS 2019, it only has one region (In Southern California), less plane functions, and is a couple bucks more. X-Plane 10, only has a handful a free planes and is just a bad flight simulator. The people who are complaining are either complaining about the price or are just mad because they aren\u2019t getting the very full game. The developers would be getting very little pay for the effort they put in if they took off the pro subscription and had to run an online server. The reason I\u2019m taking a star off is because of the price of pro, $80 dollars a year! Although there is so much features, this is a mobile game, not a professional simulator. Make it $15-$30 a year, not $80. I would pay $40 maximum if it were a one time payment for online. If you aren\u2019t happy with your purchase, just wait, occasionally developers will add another free plane or feature.</p>|This an edit of a past review I wrote two years ago which reminded me of a time during which IF was not the greatest app with regards to performance. I can't even think about that at this point - not because the issues are nonexistent now (they are no longer) - but because of such a beautiful mobile flight simulator. I commend the developers' time and effort spent on creating the most versatile mobile flight simulator on the market. I can't put it down, which is my new issue I must give a ding. The rendition of earth is beautifully crafted and accurate, the imagery is amazing. Exploring the natural beauties of our world and atmosphere from thousands of feet high for practically no cost on my part is an absolute joy. The navaid database, though not entirely complete I've realized, is still very good and importing route waypoints is a breeze, especially when you can parse out real world routes into a CSV with an app like FltPlan Go (what I've been doing...). There's still always going to be work to be done, but this global update will undoubtedly satisfy many fellow IF users for a long time before they start to worry about anything else. If you love aviation, if you are a real world pilot, if you simply love looking out the plane window during a flight (I am all of those people...), this app is definitely a must-have.  I am beyond impressed.

But there needs to be an option to delete or edit your suggested questions (before other people get the chance to rate them). If you put the right answer in the wrong spot or put the wrong info, you can\u2019t change or delete it until enough people dislike it (which it sometimes takes quite a while for people to even see your questions; I suggested a few a couple years ago and no one\u2019s even rated them). I also think there needs to be a limit on football related questions. At least every other question in the sports category has something to do with football.10/14 Edit: the more I play the more I realize how many repeated questions there are. Far too many about football, far too many pertaining to religion (by the way, biblical happenings are NOT history, sorry to break it to you), and there are just a LOT of questions about the exact same thing that are worded the exact same way. So just a tip if anyone reads this; if you rate questions and a question seems like basic knowledge (ie, \u201cwhich is the 50th state?\u201d, just today I\u2019ve answered that question three times), go ahead and choose the option that says it shouldn\u2019t be approved because it\u2019s a repeated question. It really makes the game less fun when you answer the same questions so often.</p>|I used to thoroughly enjoy this game. Now everything is about money grabbing tactics. I paid for the ad-free version because I do believe in supporting the products I enjoy. But now they stick a piggy bank on your main screen and make you believe that if you\u2019re patient enough, answer 200 questions correctly, you\u2019ll be rewarded. But alas, you can only crack it if you pay. Pay pay pay. Additionally, many of the questions are littered with spelling and grammatical errors. There is no real variety to the questions either. For sports, you\u2019re definitely getting a football question. For history, you\u2019re definitely getting something about one the King George\u2019s. Science, just know the periodic table. Pop, just know Marvel and DC comics. Geography, learn the Great Lakes or what podunk cities are/aren\u2019t in which state. And art... apparently the only thing to Art is colors. You don\u2019t need to know anything past rudimentary art class, like which colors mixed together make orange. So exciting! I will finish my current games with folks and then find another trivia app. This makes me sad, as it was such a simple pleasure after a long work day.

It is fun the first few times, but once you understand basic chance and the importance of saving your cards to save your life or screw others in endgame (and don\u2019t get unlucky early on), there is not much to do. I suppose the simplicity is deliberate, but I often find that one player might win by an absurdly large margin (i.e. he or she ends up hoarding all of the cards). It\u2019s not as though sometimes you get bad luck, sometimes others get bad luck, and it ends up evening out a little. Not at all. There seems to be a frontier at which you might as well just give up, not because you played poorly but because that\u2019s just how the game is. I consider this poor balancing, so even though the simplicity is deliberate, even though there is randomness, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a very well thought through game.Second, the mobile app does not incorporate all of the game mechanics of the card game. As other reviewers have noted, card combination rules are missing. These rules actually add a layer of complexity which you can perhaps use to your advantage if others haven\u2019t quite gotten the hang of how to properly leverage them.</p>|This is an awesome game and very addicting I don\u2019t mind the paying for the game part. The only thing ... if you guys actually do read these lol or care ha I\u2019d say if there was any way maybe you could create a way where u earn avatars for winning a certain about of times or using a a card a certain amount of times. In the beginning I kept playing over and over thinking I\u2019d achieve an unlock an avatar but nothing happen after finally realizing they all had different prices and needed to be purchased. Purchasing Was the only way to get them. If you would like my input I\u2019d say give users like prizes for playing and winning or even just playing it would keep people playing a lot more ! But other than that I really do love the game I do own the board game but nowadays people don\u2019t like sitting dealing with cards and the mess and what not lol so me and my kids and family all play together on our phones when we get together and it\u2019s just as fun if not better!

I installed it again but restarted my phone before opening it and I got all my progress back!!Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is an amazing game. They are some complaints I think you should know if you are thinking about getting this. First let\u2019s start with the pros: The campaign mode was fun. It is also fun collecting all the info on the buildings and enemies. Also, collecting new items and powers (like sticky bombs) for my assassin is fun. It is so fluid and feels natural climbing the rooftops and sneaking up on enemies. The cons: They devs need to fix the terrible forging system. I always get stuck with an item with a lower item level then the one I used to forge it and I never have enough credits to reforge the items. The game is 1.99 and has lots of in-app purchases. I understand that the developers need to make some money, but I don\u2019t think they should sell levels. Also, the campaign mode is way too short. They need to add more levels instead of paying 2 dollars for a couple of extra levels. Please add more campaign (with no in app purchases). I think they can get money in other ways. Finally, I wish that the game would get updated graphics and maybe some transportation like horses.</p>|Have to take a star away because this is assassins creed from a AAA dev (Ubisoft) and they still don\u2019t have iPhone X support (resolution wise) for this game or assassins creed pirates and that\u2019s just unacceptable. You have INDIE,LESS KNOWN DEVS, who update there games to make it iPhone X capable (again RESOLUTION WISE) but Ubisoft can\u2019t? U r a huge studio there is no reason u guys shouldn\u2019t have been one of the FIRST devs to update ur games for iPhone X. So until that gets fixed I have to take a star away, the game itself is amazing and a solid AC experience for mobile. Once the add iPhone X resolution I will gladly change my rating back to 5 stars just atm ALL devs need to get on board with this because some games SUCH AS THIS are just UNPLAYABLE with the resolution. Yah u can PLAY the game but because the screen is so tiny (because it\u2019s not updated for iPhone X resolutions) THAT\u2019S what makes it unplayable. Take whatever phone u have and just imagine if the screen was smaller that\u2019s the issue with the iPhone X u just can\u2019t play the game with such a tiny/mini screen. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR GAME!

No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.To mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.This works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).E = 2012F = 2013H = 2014J = 2015K = 2016M = 2017N = 2018R = 2019Q = QLED (also supported)For instance:UE55_E_S8000 = 2012.UE78_H_U8500L = 2014.In using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3).

Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.Limitations and known issues:1. Audio- When screen mirroring from Safari, there is no audio. We advice to use the Endless Browser instead of Safari.- Sometimes audio from other apps is not playing. In this case, start a screen mirroring session, then open the app you want to mirror. If there is no sound, just close the app you are mirroring and re-open it in the same mirroring session.2. DRMSome apps don't allow screen mirroring. For instance Netflix: when you start screen mirroring when running the Netflix app on your iPhone or iPad, the TV screen will turn black. This is a choice that Netflix made, there is nothing that we can do about that.Support:If you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.What our users are saying:\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by PmanswahAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60At first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, \u201cBingo\u201d it works a treat.

I reached out to the customer support through messenger and I could not believe how quickly I had a reply! I was having a challenge using one particular website and trying to get it to Mirror with appropriate sound through the television. The mirror part worked just fine however I could not understand why the volume would only come out of my phone. Apparently it has to do with certain websites blocking the ability to mirror and the customer service person was excellent about helping me with this and to verify it through a couple of simple steps. This app is well worth it if you wish to mirror things from your phone.  Note: some websites may only allow sound thru your device.  Support was outstanding.</p>|I wanted to watch some training videos on our Samsung smart TV via an app on my phone and I was getting frustrated trying to figure out how to do it. I tried a free app by a different developer and it didn\u2019t work. Fortunately, I discovered Mirror Samsung TV and decided to spend the five bucks and give it a try. Within just a few minutes of downloading the app, I was watching the video on the TV streaming from my iPhone. It\u2019s easy to use and works great. I don\u2019t write many reviews but I want to give kudos to the app developer.</p>|Used this app to do a presentation for family as a good test.  It worked great on both of my samsung televisions.  The only challenge was the delayed timing of action on my ipad versus the tv.  Surprisingly, it was better from my iphone than from my ipad.

The addition of line and segment removals simply cements it as a must-have app for anyone who is serious about making their scans/photos look as good as they possibly can be.  I still marvel at how I can do this on a smartphone!TouchRetouch only does a few things.  It removes objects, clones, and repairs.  The thing is, it does them really, really well.  I would be lost without this app, which has repaired/ fixed MANY damaged old photos, some which I never would have thought were repairable.  If you deal with scanned photos, it\u2019s absolutely essential!</p>|I decided to purchase this app based largely on the reviews. And it is totally worth the cost! Object removal is just as good as using Photoshop. It\u2019s easy to enlarge the area to work on, which produces a much better result. There may be some objects it will have difficulty removing, but that\u2019s not any different when working with Photoshop. I am extremely happy with your app. Thank you!!... I\u2019ve now been using this app for a few months. And I love it even more!! To get the best results, you have to zoom in heavily to the spot you want to alter, then highlight it. It won\u2019t work on a small piece if you don\u2019t zoom in. It works wonderfully!!</p>|I was dubious about this app as I didn't much like the idea of messing with my pictures especially as I am clumsy. That was about three years ago...I think I'm into the third update of Touch Retouch and they keep improving it. It's easy - really - and unobtrusive and it encourages me to take risks with my photo compositions. For instance if there is an obtrusive sign or wire I just don't care. I know how to get rid of it in seconds. The latest version makes everything easier and better integrated into your photo files than previously. Use with confidence.

I like the whole idea of getting to build your farm from the ground up, and there has been soooooo much improvement since 14. But I\u2019m more of a livestock guy and I\u2019ll admit, I was a little disappointed when the only thing added there was getting to buy and sell them as you please. I like it, but there could be more, like moving your cattle. I live on a ranch and I know you can\u2019t keep a bunch of cattle in one place all year, so let there be pastures to buy or somethin. Also for the semi I think there should be a trailer, so you can hold more. While I\u2019m on the topic of the semi a very cool effect to put in would be SMOKE. I mean they call em smoke stacks for a reason, it would even be cool with tractors. My final suggestion is just make the forestry equipment a little cheaper or make trees bring more. Like, you can\u2019t even make a profit on that. Overall tho, I\u2019m very happy with the game and would be even happier if u took these suggestions into account and/or added them. OH! One very important thing that I think would be very easy to add is making the livestock prices change. If this can be done with the crops, then surely it can be done with livestock to make it even MORE realistic. Again, thank you so much and I hope you will use my suggestions to make the game even better. Thank you.</p>|I love farming so much and so of course I love this game. But seriously, why would you farm in Arizona or wherever the setting is. There is so much canyons and rocks. Why can\u2019t you install bridges?!? Like seriously there is a tiny gap where you could put a bridge easy by the house. But NO I have to drive all the way around on the road to get to my meadow and field which takes FOREVER. I\u2019m sick of it! Also the fields are tiny, and you mow and Tedder and bale a meadow and when you give the hay to your cow/sheep they eat it so fast and they literally take forever to grow back again. I really wish you could go into the city and sell your crops there for a higher cost. I also wish that you could tell your workers to drive somewhere on the map so you could finish something quick. But also worker\u2019s pay is so much! Like you can just sit there and watch your money go down super fast. But other than those I like the game and it keeps me entertained.

I am a big fan of fnaf so I decided to get this game. Here are reviews about night 1-4. The reason I\u2019m not reviewing night 5 is because I don\u2019t have a clue on how to get to it!Night 1: pretty basic but you still have to be careful. For me the most active ones are toy Bonnie and toy Chica. If there in your hallway or vents put your mask on. Make sure to wind up the music box! Night 2: same as night 1 but the animatronics are more aggressive. Toy Freddy will be more aggressive to. For me, the hardest animatronic is withered foxy. You have to flash him with the flash light because he won\u2019t be fooled by the mask. Rarely, the withered animatronics will come after you but you don\u2019t have to worry about them. Night 3: now this is where the hard part comes in. The toy animatronics will be less aggressive except mangle. He/she was a big problem for me. The withered animatronics start to come out a lot now. Now the only reason at this point to go on the cameras is to wind up the music box. Make sure that your finger is always where you need to put the mask on because the withered animatronics will pull down your camera except foxy. Night 4: the exact same as night three but WAY more aggressive. I hope this helps you! \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc24\ud83d\udc07\ud83e\udd8a</p>|I'm on night five so I know a ton! Night1: not much to do, but! You can die. So be careful! Most active I would say is Toy Freddy, because at first, when I had no idea on how to play he killed me twice! Toy Bonnie is tricky too but There's a way to make all of them go away  ( but the puppet ) put the mask on ( the red button ) wait 5 or 4 seconds and take it off. ( or if there in the office put it on immediately! )  The Puppet you need to wind up the music box.      Night2: You may not like it but there are 5 more animatronics! Ok lets get you set up with the hardest one ( well to me ) Mangle! She ( or he ) is a little bit tricky! Because he/she is the broken down one. ( her/his name makes sense ha ha ) She shows up in the right vent and the hallway in front of you. If it's Foxy and Mangle are both there than flash 3 times and put on the mask for 3 seconds repeat. And the rest are different all the Freddy's can't squeeze their fat buts in. ( please don't hate that joke I was just trying to make this a little funny ) Withered Bonnie shows up in both vents and the hallway in front of you. Withered Chica only shows up in the right ventI will update this soon</p>|Ok, so this is definitely in my top 3 favorite FNaF Games (1. FNaF 3, 2. FNaF Sister Location, 3. FNaF 2)! It has super good graphics, jumpscares that are scary but not over-the-top like FNaF 4, AMAZING gameplay mechanics, and I love how there\u2019s a certain process to get rid of each animatronic. However, it\u2019s just a bit too easy. I got past nights 3 and 4 on my first try. (Currently on night 5)[EDIT: Night 6!] I feel like the ways to get rid of the animatronics should be more complex instead of just using the mask for a certain time to make it more immersive and challenging. Also, Mangle and Foxy are a little too active. Five seconds after I get rid of Foxy, guess what? He\u2019s there again! Also, I understand that Scott cut out a lot of mechanics from the PC version because it\u2019s, well, on mobile. But it would be nice to at least have some mechanics and part of the jumpscare animations on higher end divides such as the iPhone X or iPad Pro. Like at least add the thing where Toy Bonnie will move around your office in front of your mask! Other than that though, it\u2019s a great game!

P.S. Coffee Stain please respond and/or please fix this bug in a future update</p>|The game is overall amazing but, if you quickly switch cars and jump out and switch immediately, you have to respawn because the button to go out the car doesn\u2019t appear. Also when I respawned, the car button to leave was left while I wasn\u2019t in the car. Also, there is a problem with the ground. If you can go high enough with a car, you bounce around crazily in the air, and when I hit the top of the world when the top is black, it crashed. I know it\u2019s very Minor problems, but it really helps. Also, when I spawned from the top of the world, I was a normal goat from the original game, with the texture of it too.

This is question #1.2. As a new comer to this app, I sometimes deleted files by mistake. Although the app can upload files onto the cloud storage, I still think there should be a place where we can find the files we've already deleted just like other products of yours, like PDF Expert. This can be really helpful especially when I have some important files.3. The uploading works in a strange way sometimes that I can't understand. I always find the folders missing in my Onedrive and iCloud drive, and the files that supposed to be in those missing folders turns out to be in the primary folder. It's easy for me to delete some file in this way.4. Still the problem of uploading. I think it better to let the files on my iPhone completely conform to ones on the Cloud disk. Sometimes I may scan one file several times to get the best one, and those files are all uploaded on to my iCloud so that I can't tell which one is the best when I open my iCloud. So the best way is that when I delete some files from my phone, they will also be deleted from my Cloud storage at the same time.I'll appreciate it if you can improve some of the problems in the next version.</p>|I have owned this app for years and generally switched between it and Scanbot to get the best scans. I just used it again for the first time in a few months today to scan a multi-page document and I am blown away. Under fairly poor lighting conditions (at nighttime under a yellow lamp) Scanner Pro gave me a perfect OCR scan of my document. Both pages were perfectly aligned, the edges of the pages were perfectly clean, the angle looked perfect, the crease in the paper was gone, and the pages looked perfectly white even though I took the scan under yellow tinted lighting. I tested the scan\u2019s OCR by searching a few random words (in PDF Expert) and it worked perfectly. Wow - I don\u2019t know what secret sauce Readdle has been infusing into this app lately but it\u2019s miles ahead of where it used to be, even though it\u2019s always been one of the top quality scanning apps in the App Store. Bravo, Readdle! Keep it up! PDF Expert and Documents have been invaluable apps to me; I hope Readdle keeps pushing forward.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.6, 3.5K Ratings", "category": "Business", "sub_rank": "#2 in Business"}, {"size": "103.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/scott-cawthon/id777236428?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "This is the official mobile port of Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location!Welcome to Circus Baby's Pizza World, where family fun and interactivity go beyond anything you've seen at those *other* pizza places!

Night 1 and 2 were just fine, but on night 3...Things were strange. When you try to click the button on Funtime Freddy's Puppet, the puppet doesn't even show up! Well at least for me. Then I have to wait at least 5 minutes and I get jumpscared by the puppet. I continue to try again and again but no matter what I do, the puppet never shows up! Please fix this bug. And another bug is me when trying to click the buttons on Funtime Freddy on night 3. My fingers are sorta big. I sometimes can't click the buttons and it annoys me because I spend a minute or 2 trying to click on the button. Then I found out you have to be at a certain angle just to click the button. But I don't think that's a bug, it's probably just my fingers. But overall, I rate this game a 4 star. The bugs and glitches. make the game less fun! Even the cut scenes and the vampire show thing. I also want to see the mirror thing after you get scooped happen. Even the mini games! I mean, is there even a mini game in this game at all? I'll have to find out. I'm on night 3 so far. Hopefully you update the game and hopefully the bugs and glitches end.Take your time Scott, but try to make the bugs and glitches...not happen anymore.</p>|This game is great. I have every star in the fnaf games, including Sister Location. I have beaten all the custom night challenges in the game, but it's this one challenge that I believe is impossible which is Golden Freddy mode. I've seen people beat this challenge on PC version but I haven't seen people beat it on mobile version. I've seen Markiplier beat this challenge and I keep watching his videos to see how he beats it. Bidybab was a major problem in the mobile version because in the pc version you have to listen to thumping sounds that bidybab makes in the vents, I thought to myself, \"Eh that's not a big deal\", but then I realized that you can't hear thumping sounds that bidybab makes in the vent, which basically is the signal to let you know that bidybab is about to enter your office and jumpscare you. Apparently you can't hear that auditory cue in the mobile version which makes this challenge much harder. I can't even think of a specific reason on why Scott would just make things different on the mobile version compared to the pc version. Other than Golden Freddy mode being impossible, I still think that this game is amazing anyways. I have all 3 stars in sister location. It really bugs me to ignore that challenge. I know that I'm never gonna beat it on the mobile version so, why bother?</p>|This is By Julia Rittman.Ok, there\u2019s a lot of cool things Scott, Like Baby talking to you and guiding you, The mini game, And the funny thing about this game is the typing pad. It picks funny names, and the jump scares, Are honestly very funny in my opinion. Wat I don\u2019t like (I spell what like that) is the bugs, *MOSTLY* Those things when you in the scooping room, those little guys, when your in the suit, WHY\u2019D ya have to put them in the game?! And they come in and YOU FREAKING have to do those little click-y things and you have to restart OVER AND OVER AGAIN.... But..... Wat I said about the jumpscares are in MY opinion are VERY funny, And one thing that\u2019s super duper hard in this game, The sliding door with the holes in it when your trying to hide, And that door annoys me, BECAUSE let me tell you: you have to freaking press hard and go across the screen and close it and they open it too!!! Plus, you have to move your head and move your head, ALSO when your hiding under that desk, with that door with the holes, it annoys me when you have to press hard and go across the screen and pull, plus moving your head avoiding looking at them. Overall Scott, I love your game!!! Thanks so much for making this game!!!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 73%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.4, 4.5K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "N/A"}, {"size": "30.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 8%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/nexvio-inc/id305703973?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "AN OSCAR WORTHY APP - 8mm was used by director Malik Bendjelloul in his Oscar-winning film \"Searching for Sugar Man\"!The original retro film camera used by millions of users.8mm Vintage Camera captures the beauty and magic of old school vintage movies right through your viewfinder.

The grain patterns are extremely nice and useful and on par with some pretty expensive grain overlays. It would be very nice being able to just add the grain without adding a color effect. I hope this was helpful</p>|I was absolutely blown away by the grading this app is capable of. All the filters look so nice and somewhat professional. The one thing that would make this app perfect is having the option to change the video orientation IN APP. It's pretty annoying that whenever I record a video externally say through Instagram or the actual phone camera app, (mostly vertical videos for stories. Rarely horizontal) I save to my camera roll and whenever I open the video in the 8mm app to add a filter, it flips the orientation to horizontal or vice-versa. I had to download a third-party app just to flip the videos I record just so I can then have them be correctly orientated inside the actual 8mm app and export them vertically like I wanted them in the first place. That gets pretty annoying and is very time consuming. Nothing a super quick update could fix I'm pretty sure. But other than that, $2 really well spent \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc</p>", "four_star": "width: 18%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 55%;", "one_star": "width: 13%;", "star": "4.0, 429 Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#7 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "5.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ya-ling-yan/id1199873929?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The age of colorful live wallpapers is coming!Only works on iPhone X/iPhone 8/iPhone 8 Plus/iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus/iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus.

Like many of the other bad reviews, I am experiencing the same issues. After reading all of the other good reviews, i\u2019m convinced that they are staged or fake reviews because the good reviews are extremely good reviews. It\u2019s almost as if The creator of the app is paying people to write good reviews or doing the reviews their selves in someway or another. After every bad review, the Creator\u2018s reply with the same message with instructions on how to set the live wallpaper in your phone. The instructions are very easy to follow, but when you follow the instructions that they provide the live wallpaper does not work. In my case when I paid for a wallpaper after being deceived into paying for the app the actual wallpaper or \u201cstill picture\u201d didn\u2019t even download to my phone. This app is trash and I hope it\u2019s not around for much longer. 1 Star for a good scam</p>|I bought this app just exactly because of the bad reviews. They are unfair. I too am disappointed that the lockscreen on iPhones does not stay animated like a screensaver, but you would think any live wallpaper fan would already know that and not blame the app. I agree that the wallpapers are aimed at an adolescent boy mentality, but that should also come as no surprise to anyone who looked at this app for ten seconds before purchasing. Last, there is one semi-legit complaint, and that is that you get nothing but access for purchasing the app. That is true. It\u2019s slightly irritating, but the wallpapers aren\u2019t the same old same old, and they\u2019re worth the money if you like the previews, and especially if you think of all the other seven dollars\u2019s you\u2019ve wasted in the App Store! :)</p>|This app is a scam.   1.99 just to download the app. You get nothing for the 1.99. Just access to view the live wallpapers.  If you actually WANT one, you have to pay an additional .99 per pic or 4.99 to unlock all of them.  Then, after following the directions, you put the live wallpaper on your lock screen.  But it will only animate if you press and hold it like a Live Photo does with the iPhone camera. It does not animate on its own.  And it stops once you stop pressing on the screen.  Had I known you had to press and hold the pic down to see an animation I would not have purchased. This is not written anywhere in the app information. Why? Because they know no one would by this scam if they did!!  They took my money deceitfully, now I want a refund! I\u2019m going to report this to apple. Not sure if they will do anything but hopefully they at least remove this app or force the creator to spell out the terms!!</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 37%;", "one_star": "width: 49%;", "star": "2.8, 1.9K Ratings", "category": "Entertainment", "sub_rank": "#4 in Entertainment"}, {"size": "93.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/laan-labs/id310916919?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "AirMeasure\u2122 is The Ultimate Augmented Reality Measuring ToolKit with over 15+ unique modes to create the most accurate measurements possible.

While I like a lot about the design, usability is still too complex to understand. Accuracy seems questionable in most cases. For instance, I was testing the \u201cmeasure a human\u201d function, and my 5\u20191\u201d subject was consistently measured below his height. The App would say, \u201cPoint to the Floor\u201d and I would, then no further direction. So I would move the phone up and it would detect a face. Intuitively, once it detects the face you would think that\u2019s the measurement. Not only was it inconsistent, but I was getting measurements of 3\u20199\u201d, 4\u20196\u201d, and others below 5\u2019. I was in a well lit space with plenty of contrast. Other features, like hanging a picture on the wall, never worked for me. Detecting a plane (the wall) seemed challenging for the App, so it never really saw the wall. All the different modes are cool. Some are easy to understand and some are impossible to comprehend because the interface doesn\u2019t give you feedback about what it\u2019s doing. Many of the modes seem redundant as far as function, but they have completely different methods of getting to the function. I\u2019m not sure what the purpose of one measurement mode is over another in a lot of cases. All in all I think the App has promise, but it\u2019s no replacement for a quality laser measurement tool or a good ol\u2019 tape measure. Until it\u2019s somewhat accurate, I see no point using it.</p>|It is an AR measuring toolkit that contains a variety of modes to accurately create measurements.  This app is a great tool for the classroom for individual or collaborative activities when learning geometry, interior design, sewing, carpentry, and other ways an educator or anyone else sees fit. I measured a couple of objects and then used a tape measure to test for accuracy.  The app was pretty accurate.  There are modes that offer short tutorial videos where you can watch demonstrations. The vertical height mode allows the user to measure tall buildings and trees as well as others. Younger students would enjoy using this in school as a fun assignment to find the tallest tree or building on campus.</p>|Gave it 2 stars because it is a really slick looking app.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to use and does not work very well so performance is less than 2 stars. I got a lot of different measurements when trying to simply measure the length of my desk and, as a result, I could never rely on this measuring app.  I would always be questioning whether the result I got from the app was accurate or not - and I am not talking about fractions of an inch, I am talking about errors of over a foot.  Maybe my technique is poor, but the tutorial videos are too simplistic and they did not help me to perfect my technique so as to get consistent results.  I hope Apple does a better job with their upcoming iOS 12 measuring app because it would be a great tool if it worked and could be relied upon.</p>", "four_star": "width: 13%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 75%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.5, 7K Ratings", "category": "Utilities", "sub_rank": "#12 in Utilities"}, {"size": "34.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/left-brain-right-brain-llc/id335709061?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Get the most out of your closet - for the price of a latte or a gossip magazine, you could have a closet assistant for life!Stylebook\u00ae has over 90 features to help you curate your closet and get more out of what you own!Import your actual clothes, create magazine-style outfits, plan what to wear, create packing lists and learn more about your wardrobe with statistics like cost per wear - in this totally customizable app!AS SEEN IN THE NEW YORK TIMES JUNE 12, 2017Stylebook is an expert wardrobe organization and closet management tool created by a fashion industry insider, who got her start as an intern in the Vogue fashion closet and is an alum of Lucky magazine.Included in Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler's \"Best Travel Apps for Packing\" and Mashable's \"Ten Fresh Apps for Fashion Enthusiasts\"2014 Tabby Awards - Users' Choice Winner in the Lifestyle CategoryAvailable for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.REVIEWS\"Easily see what is working and what isn\u2019t\" - Vogue.com\"A must for Cher Horowitz types!\" - Vogue Australia\"Closet-organization apps allow you to catalog your wardrobe and play stylist...I find Stylebook to be the most intuitive.\" - New York Times\"Brilliance!\" - Lucky magazine\"Our new wardrobe secret weapon is the @StylebookApp\" - THE OUTNET.COM10 Must-Have iPhone Apps for Fashion Week - Vogue Paris\"The Clueless virtual closet exists in real life, OMG\" - Cosmopolitan UK\"...the ultimate wardrobe manager\" - InStyle\"9/10...Best wardrobe organizer ever\" - Wired App Guide\"Perfect if you've caught yourself daydreaming about tomorrow's outfit with nowhere to jot it down.\" - Wall Street Journal\"...wardrobe organization at its best\" - FabSugarFEATURES \u2022 CLOSET: add images of your own clothes\u2022 BACKGROUND REMOVAL TOOLS: cut out your clothes for easy collaging\u2022 LAY OUT OUTFITS: layer and resize clothing on a free-form canvas\u2022 OUTFIT SHUFFLE: shuffle your closet like a deck of cards to reveal new outfit ideas hiding in your closet!\u2022 ICLOUD BACKUP: protect your data by backing up with iCloud\u2022 PACKING LISTS: add whole outfits, plan how you'll pack ahead of time, generate printable checklists and infographics\u2022 STYLE STATS: insights into how you wear your clothes and outfits, including what you wear the most, what you wear the least and which items get the most bang for the buck\u2022 BROWSE YOUR CLOSET: See your closet organized by brand, fabric, color, size and more\u2022 NO LIMITS: add unlimited clothing, accessories and inspirations to your outfits\u2022 CALENDAR: plan what to wear in advance\u2022 CUSTOM CATEGORIES: add, edit or delete any category in your closet, looks and inspiration library\u2022 SHOP: shop items from store websites and try them out in your virtual closet before buying; plus, add your own stores\u2022 INSPIRATION LIBRARY: track and save your style inspiration\u2022 STYLE EXPERT: read interviews with fashion insiders, learn how to manage your wardrobe, find out how to make your wardrobe last, and more!\u2022 SEARCH: search your closet for keywords or properties like fabric, season, color, etc.\u2022 SHARE: share outfits and clothes with friends via e-mail, iMessage, Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest\u2022 WIFI TRANSFER: transmit looks, clothing items or inspiration to other iOS devices\u2022 HELP: searchable how-to manuals and demo videos included\u2022 E-MAIL SUPPORT: in case you need help, contact support@stylebookapp.comALSO FEATURED BY: - Better Homes &amp; Gardens- Good Housekeeping- Real Simple- Harper's Bazaar UK- NYLON- Marie Claire- The Los Angeles Times - Refinery29 - #1 on \"8 Fashion Apps Worth Downloading\" - The Tyra Banks Show - New York magazine's \"The Cut\" - And more - visit stylebookapp.com for the full list!

I play with my closet on my phone at bedtime and am so much less frustrated getting dressed in the morning I put each  seasonal outfits in the calendar randomly about every 10 days. I can easily look at a different day\u2019s outfit and swap the days I wear them to react to moods and weather.  It takes a little while to get pictures in... I did my favorites and kept taking pictures of items out of the dryer on laundry day. I had better luck hanging them on a hanger off a dark door and a light door using a wreath hook to get them to look more natural in pictures. Laying them down on solid sheets didn\u2019t work for me. You also don\u2019t have to edit it perfectly when you do your pictures. Definitely take the time to enter clothing colors of both solid and multi-colored items. This helps the app do marvelous things for your wardrobe.You won\u2019t believe how easy it is to add a few pieces to have some awesome new looks. When I used the shuffle feature, I found so many awesome new outfits I already had! If you like to peruse Pinterest outfits, it is so easy to make them using some basics and adding a new piece on a shopping trip. If are interested in clothing capsules, this simplifies the process. I\u2019m much happier coordinating outfits on the app than trying things on. I have so many items I love that I wasn\u2019t wearing that are now in the loop. This is going to pay off both financially and emotionally.</p>|Having a toddler is filled with sizing changes, being able to have all of her clothes organized lets me know what we have and what we need. Love being able to check this and not have to ransack my brain trying to remember if she has something already to wear with things I find for her while out shopping. Being able to set up outfits helps keep me from decision fatigue and gives my husband something to look at when he's dressing her instead of calling me up to pick something. My husband is military, so we are constantly traveling, taking at least four road trips a year to see our families. Packing usually sends me into a ball of stress and tears thinking of everything I have to do first. With this though I can plan her outfits for the trip while sitting on the couch after bedtime, with a glass of wine. So no more making a mess while going through all of her clothes trying to decide what to bring and what needs to be washed. It's been a long time since I was so excited about an app. It takes away such the mental drain of all the things that come with my daughter's clothes. Not to mention the money it saves in not buying duplicates or things she has nothing to wear with. Best $3.99 I've ever spent</p>|I came across this app when I was working for a fashion &amp; glamour magazine and have been using it now for 2 years. (I download it and started to use for similar apps, but this is the one that had everything I wanted.) I LOVE IT!!! I used to be really creative with my outfits. But at some point my closet got too big and too boring. I mean, there were good pieces in there, I just couldn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d the combinations anymore. Now, I save great outfits I come up with in the \u2018Looks\u2019 tab and I even let me friends play with my \u2018Closet\u2019 to create new looks for me. I have all possible occasions categorized under \u2018Looks\u2019 So when I need an outfit come in a matter how specific, on the fly, I\u2019m ready!

A lot of people are complaining about the game right now for no justified reasons. The big complaint is the rosters. While the rosters are not accurate the question is do they need to be. I'm coming to this game because of how great the franchise is, not because how much I love watching a Lakers game. The game isn't about idolizing our favorite players it's about letting us become a player. Secondly people are saying the controls are bad. I wish I could respond to this one, but my controls, as well as those of everyone I asked, are great. That's not the game, that's your lack of skill. Thirdly people say that the physics are bad. But the answer to that is that it's because it's a staple in NBA Jam games. Ever since the Sega Genesis (you whining kids probably don't know what it is, it's an old phone, that was hooked up to a tv and you could only play games on it, and only one at a time) the games have always had bad physics and I know that's a lot of people's favorite part. My only complaint is that Trump isn't on the Republican Team.I love what y'all do, keep up the awesome work. -Brent</p>|DO NOT BUY UNTIL EA STARTS RESPECTING ITS CUSTOMERS 1stI love how every time you \"update\" the game, it's ALWAYS worse than before! Congratulations on NEVER listening to the people that actually spend their money expecting a playable game. And who does EA have doing Player Ratings? A chimp? It's funny that the ratings are actually WORSE than before. How is it that Curry is ranked 8 for 3 point shooting? And 7 or 8 for dribbling? Are you kidding me? Yet there are tons of guys that have 9's and 10's in each of those categories that aren't even starters in the NBA lol. How is Klay Thompson not even on the Warriors squad, but Jason Richardson is? Yippee. I totally want to play as an average player instead of a champ. I can go on and on, but I'll just leave it with that 1 example. Right now, this unplayable. LISTEN TO THE FANS EA!!! Worst company there is when it comes to listening to customer complaints. It's like they go out of their way NOT to create the game everyone wants. Do not listen to 5 star reviews! Only reasons I can think of that someone would rate it higher than 1 or 2 stars is either A)Works for EA, or 2)Have never seen a real NBA game in their life, and have no idea what player stats should be. Again... Curry, best 3pt shooter of all time who can hit from half court with ease, is rated as an 8!!! MVP and he doesn't have a meaningful stat above 8. Unbelievable</p>|EA has built a great game but they have been slacking on the updates. I have some ideas that I think will really help the game. First, the game has fallen way behind on the rosters, most players have either been either A. Traded B. Retired or C. Just didn't get signed, and since the last roster update a ton of rookies have entered the league. This will greatly improve the game. Another idea that i think will help the game is the choice of jerseys. Having to play a game with the same uniforms every time gets a little irritating after a while. And I\u2019m not talking about just having a choice of just home and away but having a wide selection of uniforms. I think that will greatly improve the game. Lastly, the legends, you add legends like, Larry Bird, Manute Bol, James Worthy Etc. They were all very well known. What about the players like Micheal Jordan, Allen Iverson or Magic Johnson Etc. they were great players just like the very few legends that are in the game. That will help the help the games rating skyrocket. I really hope you will greatly consider adding my ideas to the game.

By the 3rd or 4th week of doing almost-daily workouts, my roommate noticed that I was already looking toned up. The goals that this app sets really motivated me to use it daily- I wanted to earn the free workouts! And I supposed that created the routine for me, so by the first month, my body was already asking me to work out- as opposed to the beginning, where I wanted to make up any excuse not to work out. By the 3rd month I had earned a shape that I hadn't seen in at least 10 years. I got toned up, lost weight, earned a lot of resistance, and even my mental health improved. Thank you to all the creators of seven minute workout app!</p>|Glad they did the updates required so that I could still use this app after iOS 11 released! It\u2019s easy to use, and the exercise plan is surprisingly effective for such a small time investment each day. I notice more cardiovascular endurance, stronger muscles, and more overall energy. Plus my appetite is coming under better control, I\u2019m finding more motivation to get/stay fit, and I\u2019m sleeping better. It\u2019s definitely worth it, even for an everyday Joe like me who\u2019s not the gym rat type. Having multiple workout packs help keep things from getting in a rut. I like that you can earn new workout packs with consistency\u2014nice incentive. And I love the graph to track progress. This app is a great workout buddy! So glad for it!</p>|I used to Weigh 238lbs at 5'11 and was no where motivated to go to the gym, especially due to my work ours. I got this app and Bam! Made a commitment and did 1 session a day 5 days a week M-F. I did that for 6months straight with like at most 4 days missed during the week. Nothing else, no weights, no running just the 7MWC. Bam I now weigh 184lbs. Just get home do one session no excuses and watch the results fly in. \"Keep in mind\" I also watched my diet. No extreme to call it a diet. I just gave up a few things like soda and late night eating. But I give it all to this app for the convenience it brings. Download it, trust.

The idea of having the power to make almost anything you can think of (ex. a giant friendly rainbow llama?) is amazing to me! I especially love playing this with my little brother. Unfortunately, this game is costly. First, the game itself costs 99\u00a2, which to me isn\u2019t that big of a deal. However, they proceed to charge for worlds, skin packs, and other silly things. What I personally would suggest is maybe making the game cost $1.50-$1.99 just so you can have the overall game itself. It\u2019s better to do this than to keep doling out money just so you can keep playing a great game that harnesses imagination very well!</p>|I used to like this game when I played it on my Nintendo DS because it was so unique and cool. Now it\u2019s on the App Store and I thought I\u2019d pick it up to see what has changed. First of all, you have to pay money to buy the app, which is fine, it\u2019s a good game. I then found out that the first purchase only unlocks 5 levels. Frustrated, I forked out some money to pay for the expansion. Playing through the levels, I realized that the devs really hadn\u2019t spent much time at all creating them and the game started to feel a bit cheap and repetitive. As time went on, I started to lose interest, but then something new sparked my interest. IT COSTS EVEN MORE MONEY IF YOU WANT MAXWELL TO HAVE A DIFFERENT SKIN. They made stupid skin packs with like 9 skins that cost a dollar each. If the expansion thing wasn\u2019t too much, this was for sure. This game has a thumbs down from me now.</p>|This was an amazing game! It lets  imagination run wild. I love this game! There is something I do not like though. This game already costs money, but then there is a lot of in app purchases. They only give you 3 boy avatars, and give you a girl if you sign up for something! There are many more avatars, but you have to purchase them in packs! Plus, they only give you 5 worlds to play at, unless you want to purchase more! I think that if you make someone purchase an app for money they should get the unlimited plan. This game is great, but they are crazy to make people have to buy stuff in a game that cost money. \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 51%;", "one_star": "width: 23%;", "star": "3.6, 1.8K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#2 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "140.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 9%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/navionics-s-r-l/id294013906?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "THIS APP WILL BE DISCONTINUED!\u200b &gt; SEARCH\u202fthis\u202fstore for\u202four\u202f\u201cBoating\u202fMarine\u202f&amp;\u202fLakes\u201d FREE app.\u200b &gt; Download\u202fit\u202fand\u202fget\u202fa 2-week trial of the\u202fsubscription\u202fto check out the\u202fcharts and\u202ffeatures.\u202fThen\u202fsubscribe.\u202f\u200b Boating\u202fMarine &amp;\u202fLakes\u202fis\u202fa favorite\u202famong\u202fcruisers,\u202fanglers,\u202fsailors, and\u202fdivers, with\u202fthe\u202fsame\u202fdetailed\u202fcharts and\u202fadvanced\u202ffeatures\u202fas\u202fon the best GPS\u202fplotters.\u200bWith\u202fBoating\u202fMarine &amp;\u202fLakes\u202fyou\u202fwill\u202fget:\u200b &gt;THE MOST DETAILED CHART LAYERS\u202fFOR OFFLINE USE\u202f-\u202fNautical\u202fChart,\u202fSonarChart\u2122 and Community\u202fEdits.\u202fPlus,\u202flocal\u202finformation from the\u202fGarmin\u202fActiveCaptain\u202fCommunity.\u200b &gt; DAILY CHART UPDATES, more\u202fthan\u202f2,000\u202fevery\u202fday!\u200b &gt; ADVANCED FEATURES like Dock-to-dock\u202fAutorouting, Advanced\u202fMap\u202fOptions\u202fand more!\u200b Search for \"Boating\u202fMarine &amp;\u202fLakes\u201d and\u202fdiscover\u202fmore.\u200b</p>", "subtitle": "The world\u2019s #1 boating app", "title": "Boating USA", "similar": "  Aqua Map Marine - Boating GPS\n,  i-Boating: Marine Charts & Gps\n,  PRO CHARTS - Marine Navigation\n,  Garmin ActiveCaptain\n,  iNavX - Marine Navigation\n,  onX Hunt: #1 GPS Hunting Map\n", "two_star": "width: 7%;", "price": "Navionics Srl a socio unico \u00a9 2017.", "inapp_purchase": "N,/,A", "autor": "NAVIONICS S.R.L.", "reviews": "|Get Fish Spots app instead, has all the FREE FEATURES navionics USED TO HAVE FREE BUT TOOK AWAY UNLESS YOU PAY AGAIN!!!

Loved every second of it. The idea that I can be in charge of my own burger shop making and customizing my restaurant    With a wide selection of props and items to buy knowing a lot of progress still has to be done before I can be satisfied. I bout myself a phone at age 13 and downloaded this game knowing how good it was. I was overly disappointed with the items(not enough) I think I beat the game in less than a week I stopped playing and finally came back to it today. This was my favorite game ever to play and when I look back at the memories I tense up. I'm overly disappointed and this should be appointed too. This should be an issue that everyone is facing. I feel that I speak  for everyone that there should be some updates in the future. Best regards to my favorite game my favorite company and to those that love this game as much as I do. If u feel that u can relate to me please put up a review so that u get ur real dollars worth. Thank you.</p>|To start off, I will say that I LOVE this game. it\u2019s a great game and a fun thing to pass the time, but with that being said, it definitely is in need of some serious updates. I wish that as you leveled up, you would have access to buy more things. you run out of things to buy pretty quickly. then it\u2019s just repetitive. I think you should add maybe a frying station for fries or onion rings or something like a real restaurant would have. and a drink station. and the ability for the customers to order more than one burger and more ingredients and different types of buns. just add and expand the game more. make it more and more challenging as it goes on but keep the grading about the same. just more things to do at once. also being able to customize your character would be cool. feel more personal. overall, this is a super fun game and definitely worth the dollar. just wish y\u2019all would add more things to it. thank you!</p>|I really enjoy the game and everything about it. It\u2019s extremely addictive and has tons of replay-ability, but whenever I try to use the button to speed up the cooking times for the burgers on the grill, the entire game just craps itself. The timers on the burgers will completely freeze and stop cooking, buttons will disappear when I go to click them and it results in me having to completely restart the game and start the level all over again. This button is really useful and it\u2019s a shame that this happens. I know the game itself is relatively old but please work on a fix for this.</p>", "four_star": "width: 15%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 56%;", "one_star": "width: 9%;", "star": "4.0, 75 Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#16 in Simulation"}, {"size": "157.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/oringe-inc/id1057795281?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "You've found the authentic Word Swag\u2122 app!

Pictures seem to come from a database which is rarely updated and search options are limited. There are times this app glitches and it won't let you choose a photo, other times its fine. One of the biggest issues I have with this app is the limitations on resizing the text after you've already filled it out. Instead of being able to pinch and grab and the text rearrange to fit the space, it just makes the text smaller or larger which means, for people like me, you have a challenge on your hands with long pieces. You have to go through and manually space, hope you don't touch the random phrases on the side and screw up everything you typed out. I love this app, but we need more variety! I maxed out my interests and ability to use the picgures/fonts at about 6 months on pro. Now unless there's some more variety added, I'll have to start using other apps :(</p>|this app is great, don't get me wrong. the styles, colors, fonts, and quote generators are amazing!!! the only problem with this app is that it is a little overpriced and not worth the amount of money spent. 5.00 is a lot of money to spend on an app for adding text to a picture. if you are using this for a business, i would definitely recommend as it will provide you with many useful tools. however, if you want to use this for, like, one Instagram picture to get the perfect one, i would try something that doesn't hurt your wallet as much. also, the in app purchases (which of course i purchased on instinct but later regretted) are overpriced as well, at 3.00 for 3 extra font styles. also, the quote generator isn't the best of all time. besides those things, this app is great. the styles and fonts are amazing and are so fun to play around with. hope this review helped you out. sorry for the huge essay i just wrote but hopefully some of this information was helpful.</p>|I have had this app for almost two years now and I use it for my business. It has been truly wonderful, and free. I have used it almost daily. I got a notification a while back telling me that I qualified for the FREE PRO VERSION since I was one of the originals or something like that. Last night I tried opening my app to edit a pic. Nothing but a black screen. So I updated the app. Nothing. I waited till this AM thinking there was a glitch... then I got a notification to update my iPhone. So I did. As soon as I got my phone back up and running, I went back to the word swag app, it was still the same. Black. Couldn\u2019t access anything. I decided to delete the app and re-download it. IT FINALLY WORKS!! Yaaayyy!! And now I have to pay $5 plus tax a month for it...... total bummer! And that\u2019s what is going to kill this rating. Do I think this app is worth charging for? Of course!! It\u2019s an amazing app, but $5??? A month?? Def not!! Not sure how long I will keep this for that price. Also, I wish there was a way to get this resolved... it\u2019s very disappointing.</p>", "four_star": "width: 6%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 91%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.9, 55.4K Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "N/A"}, {"size": "25.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 1%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/tantsissa/id861650887?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Automatically track your sleep from your Apple Watch*.

It's extremely simple.If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. As everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. If you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. *Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping.

What I love most about it is that it uses multiple data sources\u2014movement of your watch, movement of your phone, and your heart rate from your watch to make a pretty accurate reading of when you were asleep. Although several of its competitors support showing heart data, most don\u2019t actually use your heart rate for sleep detection. It also doesn\u2019t try pseudo-scientific REM sleep detection (my understanding is that you can\u2019t do this accurately with a wrist tracker, even though some apps pretend to); it just tries to understand when you were in restless sleep and when you were in restful sleep. And it allows you to carefully tweak the analysis so it fits you exactly.It doesn\u2019t offer an intelligent alarm or snoring recordings/detection. These would be my biggest requests. But you can use this in tandem with other apps that do that. Also, it would be nice if you could tweak the \u201cphone movement\u201d threshold. For example, it should be easy to tell when you\u2019re in extremely disordered sleep because you\u2019re pressing the snooze button on your phone. Right now you can either turn phone detection on or off, and if you turn it on, snooze button interaction with multiple alarms shows up as awake.Overall great app though\u2014an easy five stars.</p>|THIS SHOULD BE ON THE APPLE WATCH OUT OF THE BOX!!! Both apps are $5 bucks total. NOTHING when you consider the cheapest apple band is $50!! And this offers soooo much versatility for your watch. I literally would have sold this Apple Watch if it were not for these apps! They NEVER CRASH AND NEVER HAVE AN ISSUE!! also the heart watch can ALERT YOU  WHEN YOUR HEART RATE IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE WATCH SHOULD DO!!! THE AUTO SLEEP TRACKING IS AS GOOD AND AS DETAILED AS FITBIT! For 2 bucks?!!? Come on that's a crazy deal, and the watch still has a full day battery even if you wear it to bed. I use it for voice to text alerts and emails all day at work and tracking a workout in morning with continuous heart rate tracking and still from putting it on at 10pm to track sleep , exercise at 6am, to work till 5 pm the watch still has about 20% left at 7-8pm. And if I charge it after waking from tracking sleep, for just 5 - 10 mins while I get ready in morning, brush and make coffee, it is back to 100%!! Again, Apple should be sooooo grateful that this company made these apps. I love that cardiogram is doing heart health studies with their apps and it's free, so we should all do it for the study, but THESE APPS, heart watch and auto sleep are waayy better cleaner and absolutely worth every cent. They are ESSENTIAL if you have an Apple Watch!</p>|I\u2019ve had several activity trackers over the decade. They have had their strengths and weaknesses. Up until now, the Jawbone UP3 was the best for sleep tracking. My Garmin Vivoactive HR was great for activity, but terrible for monitoring sleep. I finally gave in to the Apple Watch series 4, and love it, but am still surprised that they don\u2019t outright offer sleep tracking. I have a varied schedule and work nights, so knowing how behind or on track with sleep is very difficult. I skeptically bought the AutoSleep triad of apps and have been amazed at their accuracy. The auto sleep detect has been right on. And I am impressed with the ability to distinguish deep sleep. I can tell when that is accurate as well... I\u2019ve felt tired after 7 hours of sleep and the app shows I got no deep sleep. Conversely, I\u2019ll make up for it with 6 or 7 hours of sleep and have 3 hours of deep sleep and I feel great. So I know it\u2019s accurate. The breakdown of my averages of sleep and heart rate are very useful as well. It\u2019s not perfect. I\u2019ve taken naps in the late afternoon that it has missed. But overall, the accuracy is stunning.This is money extremely well-spent. It adds so much value to my Apple Watch for me. I can\u2019t believe Apple has ignored this aspect of its health applications. But AutoSleep is about as good as it gets.</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 81%;", "one_star": "width: 3%;", "star": "4.7, 16K Ratings", "category": "Health & Fitness", "sub_rank": "#2 in Health & Fitness"}, {"size": "42.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/pankaj-goswami/id1453844207?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Just with a few taps, create professional grade superimposed or juxtaposed photos on your iPhone!

It allows you to erase pieces, delete the background, etc, but I find that running the photos through this app first lets me do everything in a much neater, cleaner way and the photos end up looking SO much better.

I have tried so many different superimpose and edit apps looking for this one and NONE of them come close to this app. No joke. I love this app and refuse to tell most of my fanfic friends about it because my stuff usually turns out better than theirs and I want to keep it that way.(lol) I've gotten a lot of likes for my superimposed fanfic photos. Love this app.</p>|I\u2019ve downloaded this app a few years ago and i\u2019m still using it. One thing that i love about it is that after you purchase the app, everything is yours. You don\u2019t have to pay for more filters or more tools. it gives me the unlimited feel of doing anything in the app without limits.Another thing is that i\u2019ve improved,, so much. I was looking for an app that would give me the tools and everything i need for editing and SuperImpose gives me that. I came from making simple edits to make difficult, complicated edits that makes it look easy to do.One thing that makes me like it even more is that it looks SIMPLE. Simple,, as in it looks easy to use. Well, that\u2019s just my opinion. There\u2019s this small glitch or bug which i\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve fixed this or not but everytime i log in to use it, i use the eraser tool and a message pops up.

It feels like a rip-off considering the game is \u201c unlimited\u201d because this makes you believe you can access all the characters. The game also needs more words added.

Make adjectives to certain characters more realistic , like people looking more like your main character, some 2d editing designing advanced the characters Maxwell, Lily and there parents a kind of person.

One of the iconic Hasbro games that has stood the test of time like Monopoly, Operation, and Battleship. But i\u2019m not here to talk about those games. I\u2019m here to talk about the iconic detective game. First off, this version follows the rules from the original board game. With one exception. In the original game, if someone was in a room, you couldn\u2019t enter it. Here? you can enter a room, regardless if it\u2019s empty or not. Aside from that, all strategies you made from playing the original board game will work in this version. Also, I like how you can either play against strangers online, play against your Facebook friends online, or play offline against the computer. Multiplayer is, after all, a core aspect of Clue/Cluedo. And being able to play it regardless of connection is AMAZING. And finally, I enjoy how everything you need to start playing comes with a single purchase. Yea you can buy other characters, areas, ect. But they are just cosmetics to change the game\u2019s appearance. But, characters you can buy are other characters that don\u2019t appear in the most recent version. Like Ms. White. Who was replaced by Dr. Orchid in the most recent version of Clue/Cluedo. 10/10 would play again</p>|I read all the reviews before I bought the App. Played the first game and loved it. After playing many more games I bought the very expensive clue boards and characters pack. I am not sorry I did, it really makes the game so much better. Now for some board suggestions: 1. Outer space theme...with an alien as a weapon 2. Spy theme, like James Bond. 3. Caribbean Cruise 4. Christmas theme..top priority for sales guaranteed 5. High school reunion 6. Island paradise 7. College campus murder 8. Zoo murder 9. Remote Antarctic research lab 10. Remote summer camp by a lake 11. Murder at a wedding...with scarlet as a bride of course. 12. Underwater research station 13. 50\u2019s, 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s themed event 14. Theme park murder 16. Death in the sky... on an airplane 17. Adventure/ Tomb raiding expedition...maybe in the pyramids. 18. Death on the Nile...river boat murder....and don\u2019t forget lots more great costumed characters. This makes the game extra special and adds a ton of replay value.</p>|Solo is great, while multiplayers needs some improvement such as:-Kicking out those who stall every turn or who disconnect.  We have to wait minutes just for them to make a move or hit continue since they are either trolling, taking too long, or disconnected.  A normal 6 person game that usually takes 20 minutes took 40 minutes.-Awards and permanent score system is needed.  We play games just for the leaderboard to reset, so whats the point of playing 100+ games just to have it reset?  We need some incentive more than just a temporary leaderboard.  Why not have a permanent leaderboard or level system to unlock new characters or boards that you can\u2019t just buy?-Chat system is needed.

Carrot comes very close to my ideal.  The \u201csnark\u201d factor is amusing and unique and, while others will no-doubt continue to use it, I moved beyond it pretty quickly  and just use the \u201cboring\u201d mode!  Carrot is extremely well thought out, with current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts arranged in a smart and very readable layout.  I love being able to switch between Dark Sky and Wunderground weather sources with a tap, and quick access to the radar map is a real plus.  The only other weather app that has this combination of features and design smarts is BeWeather (another excellent weather app), and it\u2019s a real horse race between the two.  What disappoints me about Carrot and keeps it from being a 5-Star app is the conspicuous lack of baked-in notifications.  To get severe weather alerts on your iPhone, you must purchase a separate app for your Mac and then have the two devices talk to each other via iCloud.  Way too many steps and $$ for something that is the de facto standard in most other first-rate weather apps.  I really hope the Carrotians will re-consider this approach.  That would garner 5 stars from me and a renewal of my subscription.</p>|Finally a weather app that does everything you need, does it accurately, and actually keeps the watch updated without having to open anything. There\u2019s more information on the watch than I really need which is pretty good, cuz it\u2019s there if I want it without having to hunt for it.   I tried a bunch before trying Carrot.  I always ended up getting a refund they were so lousy.  None of them were very accurate, or they drained my battery as fast as it could.  One required location services on always or it wouldn\u2019t even load.  Insane.  Location services sitting in my living room??  If I don\u2019t travel who cares??  I\u2019m not a fan of subscription services but for what you get with carrot it was worth it to me.  The snarky comments are entertaining, and the layout is easy to read &amp; visually pleasing. The layout isn\u2019t overly bogged down with page after page of charts, maps, and other junk.  Simple &amp; straightforward with nice little surprises showing up in the artwork.  Customer service gives quick friendly responses, without making you feel like a dummy for asking. I really like this weather app better than any other.</p>|At first, I liked the attitude that came along with the weather. The jokes were kind of funny. Then, they became annoying like that smartass you know that thinks they are hilarious but they really are just being jerks. Yeah, this app is a jerk. It\u2019s also extremely liberal. I set my settings to conservative because I don\u2019t want to hear snowflake jerk comments when I\u2019m trying to just look at the weather. Still get liberal comments, just not as harsh. So it\u2019s been confirmed that a \u201cNot my President\u201d\u2019er is the one that comes up with all these \u201cclever\u201d insults. Now onto what really matters....the weather is NOT accurate. Literally, right now, it says it\u2019s snowing where I\u2019m at and we can expect between 7-10\u201d of snow today. It\u2019s barely drizzling and our local news and every other news and radar shows we are not getting snow today, maybe a little ice but mostly rain. That\u2019s a HUGE difference from what Carrot has to say. Now if later on today we get that much snow, I\u2019ll change this to 4 stars (minus one for the liberal crap). I\u2019m mad I spent my money on this app, but I took a risk and that\u2019s how Capitalism works. Imagine that. A liberal company benefiting from capitalism.

I pray that the developers see the potential to make more episodes of this game. There are so many possibilities and journeys yet to come. Now that I have completed both versions, I am left wanting more, so much more that I feel a little empty.

The art and music were on point, but the levels themselves were shorter, simpler, and far less intriguing than those in the first. The difficulty/complexity of the first game made it rewarding to play and also increased the playtime such that retrospectively I\u2019d have happily paid twice the asking price to download the first... on the other hand I\u2019d tell anyone who hasn\u2019t played these to only buy the first and forgotten shores and skip MV2 (or play it first).MV2 also seemed to have a smaller set of puzzle mechanics. Typically in this game you are limited to rotating platforms and sliding platforms. In MV1 you had these, but you also manipulated the entire map relative to camera angle, redirected water flows, channeled bird people to/from switches etc. The only new mechanic in this game was having two characters that you could direct which ultimately functioned as an easier version of the NPC birds or smaller version of the block friend you work with.In short, the first game had puzzles, clever mechanics, presented a challenge and had a compelling storyline. MV2 felt like a reader rabbit game; a children\u2019s interactive storybook with simple references to the original. The first game involved multiple sessions of play, this one I finished in under an hour.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 67%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.3, 3.5K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#13 in Puzzle"}, {"size": "27.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 9%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/infinity-pocket/id372365588?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0  Appstore BEST of 2012 (PAID/GROSSING) \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0  Flick your finger and make a homerun.You can experience a real baseball batting through the physical pendulum.

I kept waiting until I forgot about it. Two iPhones later there's an update and I found that all my levels and accomplishments were gone.  Ok, no big deal I said. Since its been a while I last played it, it will be fun to do it all over again, or so I thought. They must have added new levels in the new version, I thought. Instead what I found is the exact same game with the difference that the developers added a bunch of ads in a paid application and now they sell you all the things you could earn before as in-app purchases. They rigged the game so you can't complete the levels without buying bat power, eye contact and other traits you would earn as you played in the older version. The developers should be ashamed of themselves since it is blatantly obvious they are doing this on purpose to get more money out of paying customers. If you are considering buying this, just know you will never complete all the levels unless you pay 4 or 5 times the listed price. The fun is over at the second level. The game will never let you go pass the next level unless you buy extra add ins. Your bat mysteriously stops working as it should. It will frustrate the heck out of you. You have been warned.</p>|Ok so this is kinda stupid how the developers haven't fixed the glitch where you hit the ball and it glitches backward in sure I'm not the only one I mean this game has been out for awhile and this should have been on the top priority list like adding more levels cool and all but what's the point if a glitch is making you get out all the time? Also I bet this isn't the first complaint about this I'm surprised how many stars it has cause this is also a rigged game  hopefully sometime in the future people will start to understand that some games just want your money. Other than that it's pretty fun until they add updates and you lose all your progress. Ok I paid some good money for this game and it is terrible I mean like developers if your reading this then make some changes my game always crashes when I get it for real!? This is one of the biggest issues I've had with your game I'd rather play my little ponie then a game that crashes idk what it is but you need to get it together or your ratings are gonna drop way down which in the position that I'm in right now I hope your ratings drop to a 1 stAr. And to the people who actually enjoy this game trust me after a while you'll say to yourself \"well that was a waste of money and time.\"</p>|UPDATE: Definitely some shady business here. Recently I was at level 20 and leveled up two times.  Not thinking anything of it, I didn't even bother to look at the actual number of the score. I recently leveled up for the third time, and noticed that my score was still at 20 in power. Absolutely unacceptable. When a company makes you pay him for leveling up and then doesn't give you the levels when you actually do it just shows that something crooked is going on. Leveling system is completely ludicrous. It would take weeks upon weeks of casual playing to level up one time once you've gotten to higher levels. Like another reviewer mentioned, 5000 points nets you only 50 XP and at my level, it'll take 5448 XP to reach the next level, only to receive 1 lousy point to use.  The achievements are also far-fetched. 2000 stars to complete a level 1 achievement, whereas my average stars is between 10-20 per game. Definitely needs some sort of updating to facilitate the leveling system.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 52%;", "one_star": "width: 20%;", "star": "3.7, 796 Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#4 in Sports"}, {"size": "18.9 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/futuremind/id392259659?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "The original AdBlock - the last ad blocker you'll ever need.

In this case, however, I had to write a review. I started using this app almost a year ago and was very happy with it as it worked to block ads 95% of the time in my games, apps, sites, etc. Recently, Apple decided for some stupid reason that AdBlock wasn\u2019t allowed to block ads in the way they had been doing after it had been on the store for probably a year or more. Why Apple did that is just plain idiotic after so many people paid for this app and the developer depends upon Apple not destroying their app. I figured this meant AdBlock would cease to function at all and I\u2019d be back to ad-Armageddon on my phone. I\u2019m glad I was wrong! This new DNS based ad blocking is phenomenal and in my experience it is now blocking all ads in every app I\u2019ve tried so far, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen a single ad yet. The user interface is extremely well polished and the options are very flexible. The built in DNS logging inside AdBlock also allows you to manually block an ad if it\u2019s not caught by the preset filters. All of this is to say, buy this app. I no longer have to sit through ridiculous 30 second long video ads in apps or have fraudulent pop ups show up saying my iPhone has a virus. The state of ads on iOS is atrocious and they seriously degrade the user experience. Thank you AdBlock for solving this!</p>|Ok so, I downloaded this app thinking it would stop the random videos popping up throughout the games I am playing. My friend recommended me the app. I paid for it with a gift card I had acquired, and I\u2019m 75% sure that it charged me twice.      My friend stated that the app removed many different videos in games she also plays. I downloaded the app, and I find that there is no difference. I would appreciate it if the developers gave me my money back, and I remove the app. Throughout the reviews they seem pretty well, but I saw one that says Apple stopped them from blocking the ads. Which is dumb? I\u2019m paying money to block the ads, then the developers of the games I play make more money off of me? I feel cheated, but I can deal.       I gave it a three star review, 1) because I think I was charged twice, and 2) because I don\u2019t believe that this app quenched my needs. People seem to be blaming Apple for that, so I guess I will as well. Also this is the first review I\u2019ve ever written, so I apologize if its a mess. Grammar is difficult.</p>|It It actually works. To be honest I really didn\u2019t think it would. I don\u2019t need another ad blocker app that advertised that it would block ads on safari and in apps, but after I spent 2.99 on it, I found out that it didn\u2019t. This one on the other hand works perfectly. Simply search the Internet for \u201cdns list future minds ad blocker\u201d. You\u2019re find a Reddit Page that links to list on github. (There are several so any that seem to be updated somewhat regularly will do.) Import that list and start the ad blocker. If the ads on the website or app you want aren\u2019t blocked, simply enable dns logging on the ad blocker app, then open the dns log right after the ad pops up and block the links on the top of the list. Boom. It took me about 5 mins to block the stubborn ones. Most of them were gone as soon as I imported the list from github.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 75%;", "one_star": "width: 11%;", "star": "4.3, 21.8K Ratings", "category": "Utilities", "sub_rank": "#2 in Utilities"}, {"size": "132.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 8%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/savage-interactive-pty-ltd/id363433636?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Built for creative professionals, Procreate Pocket is the most powerful sketching, painting and illustration app ever designed for iPhone.

I\u2019ve recently purchased the app on my iPhone in hopes that I would be able to use the same wonderful drawing app I know and love without having to carry around a huge iPad Pro wherever and whenever I want to draw, but I\u2019m struggling to find any situation where I\u2019ve ever felt comfortable using the application on the iPhone. I feel like I\u2019ve had too high of an expectation from the iPad app to really see where the pocket version can shine but I cannot say that it would ever be a viable alternative to the iPad version let alone be some form of replacement. It\u2019s lack of features that the iPad has like the extra drawing guides, liquify and quick shape are some of the biggest features that I would have really liked to have seen on Pocket, but sadly aren\u2019t included as of making this review. I really want this app to succeed, but right now it\u2019s simply unusable since I\u2019m so used to the iPad version. I would also HIGHLY recommend some sort of cloud syncing if that isn\u2019t already a feature so I can work on my projects across devices. Seeing as this isn\u2019t an option right now from what I\u2019ve seen, this is a huge bummer because It takes away one of the big reasons I wanted to purchase it in the first place.</p>|I recently purchased this app and have been enjoying it so far! I really love the endless possibilities in terms of customizing your brushes and creating your own palettes. However, I\u2019ve been running into one small issue: functionality. The app randomly crashes without warning. It doesn\u2019t freeze, or lag, it just crashes. I never know when it\u2019s coming, so I\u2019m constantly frustrated, having to re-open the app and go back to my artwork over and over. My phone does not have any storage issues, and none of my other apps ever crash like this. I\u2019m concluding it must be an issue with the app itself. I have an iPhone 7. Hopefully this issue is fixed(especially if I\u2019m not the only one having it), because it is a small one, and the app is great otherwise!Edit: I have updated my phone to see if that would solve the issue, but the app is crashing twice as much now. This is definitely proving to be an issue that I can\u2019t avoid, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to refrain from using the app until an update is available.</p>", "four_star": "width: 16%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 54%;", "one_star": "width: 16%;", "star": "3.9, 922 Ratings", "category": "Entertainment", "sub_rank": "#1 in Entertainment"}, {"size": "32.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/samer-azzam/id503806808?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "TRUSTED BY OVER 6.5 MILLION USERS---------------------------------------------------SHOOTING MODES - Photo- Night Mode- Burst Mode- Slow Shutter - iPhone 5 / iPad 3 and later- Portrait Mode - requires dual lens camera system- 3D Photos - requires dual lens camera system- Video- Time LapsePHOTO SHUTTER RELEASE OPTIONS- Self-Timer - Anti-Shake- Screen Shutter / Big Button- IntervalVIDEO FRAME RATES AND RESOLUTIONS- VGA, 720p, 1080p- 4K Ultra HD - 3264x1836 upscaled to 3840x2160 - in-app purchase - iPhone 5s / iPad Air 2 and later- 4K Ultra HD - 3840x2160 - native support on iPhone 6s / Plus and later- 4K Max - 4032x2268 - in-app purchase -  iPhone 6s / Plus and later- High frame rate:* 48 / 50 / 60 fps 720p - iPhone 5 / iPad mini and later  * 96 / 100 /120 fps 720p - iPhone 5s / iPad Air 2 and later * 192 / 200 / 240 fps 720p - iPhone 6 and later * 48 / 50 / 60 fps 1080p - iPhone 6 and later* 96 / 100 / 120 fps 1080p - iPhone 6s / Plus and later* 192 / 200 / 240 fps 1080p - iPhone 8 and later * 48 / 50 / 60 fps 4K - iPhone 8 and later  TIME LAPSE FRAME RATES AND RESOLUTIONS- VGA, 720p, 1080p- 4K Ultra HD - 3264x1836 upscaled to 3840x2160 - in-app purchase - iPhone 5 / iPad Air 2 and later- 4K Ultra HD - 3840x2160 - native support on iPhone 6s / Plus and later- 4K Max - 4032x2268 - in-app purchase - iPhone 6s / Plus and later- High frame rate:* 48 / 50 / 60 fps 720p - all devices* 48 / 50 / 60 fps 1080p - all devices* 48 / 50 / 60 fps 4K - iPhone 5 / iPad Air 2 and later* 48 / 50 / 60 fps 4K Max -  iPhone 6s / Plus and laterMANUAL CONTROLS- Manual exposure, shutter speed, ISO, focus, and white balance controls- Scroll and steppers system inspired by DSLR cameras- Tap location accurate manual focus assist- True focus peaking- Zebra stripes - overexposure warning- Live shutter speed, ISO, focus, and WB values- Manual controls are supported in all photo and video modesMAIN CAMERA FEATURES- RAW (DNG) iOS 10 - iPhone 6s / iPad Pro 9.7 and later- Lossless TIFF file format support- Intelligent 3-shot HDR- AEB (Auto Exposure Bracketing) with RAW support for high contrast conditions- Live light level histogram- Adjustable aspect ratio (4:3 / 3:2 / 16:9 / 1:1) - Video pause/resume functionality - Video audio meter (Avg. / Peak signal levels) - Still photo capture during video recording - Realtime video stabilization (ON/OFF) - Video disk space indicator - Thirds grid and horizontal tiltmeter. - Date / time / location / Copyright stampPHOTO / VIDEO EDITOR &amp; PHOTO EDITING EXTENSION- Nondestructive editing - all edits, including cropping, are completely amendable / reversible - 60 expertly crafted filters- 17 lenses: Vignette / White Vignette / Fisheye / Tilt Shift / Macro / Tiny Planet / Wormhole / Split / Kaleidoscope I, II, III, IV, V / Ripple / Striped / Hatched / Halftone- 19 comprehensive adjustment tools- Trimming, cropping, rotating, mirroring, straightening, and perspective correction- Extremely accurate timeline with the ability to review videos frame by frame- Ability to add background music</p>", "subtitle": "Manual Camera + RAW", "title": "ProCam 5", "similar": "  Enlight\n,  ProCamera.\n,  FiLMiC Pro\n,  Slow Shutter Cam\n,  Halide Camera\n,  ACDSee Pro\n", "two_star": "width: 1%;", "price": "$5.99", "inapp_purchase": "N,/,A", "autor": "Samer Azzam", "reviews": "|It\u2019s rare when I\u2019m really blown away by an app (paid or free) and there are many where one wonders if it is even worth space on their phone (like some poorly developed apps that don\u2019t really provide good function or UI or say on the other case Facebook with it\u2019s 300MB install size). This is easily one of the absolute best and must have apps out there for its category/purpose. Have had it for years and I have always been impressed. Really does help unlock the features &amp; power of your iPhone camera. There are really a ton of great other features I do suggest investing the time to look at their tutorials/documentation to understand &amp; take advantage of all of the features and functions under the hood. Aside from all of the awesome pre/post features and controls for photo and video - one simple thing that is absolutely my favorite for years is the ability to easily control video resolution and size. Often for web purposes, Ultra4k, 1080p, and even 720p aren\u2019t required in some situations for videos (when traveling for example where taking lots of photos, panos and videos, sometimes we may need to document something by video and take longer videos but don\u2019t need to output them in high res), this is great to capture moments but helps save space rather than simply using iOS\u2019 default built-in resolutions.</p>|It\u2019s crazy how the app \u201cCameraPixels\u201d another premium - similar to yours - camera app has focus bracketing AND bracketing in general for HDR photo taking, up to 15 photos of different exposures. Why does this - you - advertise as the best, but seem have zero intention to implement these features. Also camera pixels has the ability to LOCK the shutter speed in video to achieve and actual 180 shutter angle when recording video. Allowing ISO to change dynamically and extremely fast. You - ProcCam 4, and 5 - only allow the user to set the shutter Manuel - in video -to achieve the desired shutter angle, even worse the iso can\u2019t be set to AUTO when shutter speed is in Manuel - in video mode -. So when recording, this desired setup only allows the user to change iso Manuel. Creating pretty UN-Smooth exposition change / gradation when recording. Also, please implement a more Manuel long exposure, instead of always blowing iso outa wack when detecting a really dark scene. AND PLEASE ALLOW 4K MAX video to be uploaded to google drive / similar services when pressing that share button.</p>|Awesome for capturing doccuments, but the OCR doesn\u2019t do very good for store receipts. I\u2019m guessing that the latest iPhone doesn\u2019t have the power to do very good OCR on small text that isn\u2019t crisp. But I did get a little better results by making the receipt text a little larger. I took three 5 foot high filing cabinets and used it to copy all of the documents, and moved them into folders (albums) in my Photos folder, and it\u2019s all backed up on the iCloud for a couple bucks per month, with an additional backup on a 512G USB memory stick. Then I tossed the filing cabinet in the trash :) If I ever need to alter one, this app allows moving it back and doing an OCR. I spent 20 years designing databases, so I am also creating a database app that is 100 times better than the iPhone Photos app, with the ability to use multiple folder levels and naming and searching capability for the picture documents. So I will be moving all of the documents to the database when I am done. The bottom line is that I love this ScannerPro app.</p>", "four_star": "width: 12%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 80%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.6, 17.3K Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#25 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "145.3 MB", "three_star": "width: 7%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/bolt-creative/id295456048?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "What kind of god would you be?

I remember back in school we would wait every week for the new updates. Whenever a new update came out, my friends and I gathered together and played with all the new features. This game was great, so sad it's over. Re-downloaded it after years of not playing it, and it's cool to see a few new things. People are complaining that there aren't any updates, but they don't know that episode 47 was supposed to be the last one. They did episode 48 just because of popular demand. While I do wish there was a way to have alien pygmy's, werewolves, and female pygmy's, the game is packed with fun things to do. Maybe if the developers come back they can make 2 more episodes to finish it off? Just because 50 episodes is a lot cooler than 48 haha. Personally love the app, just kinda sad the graphics are the same and not high resolution like other apps. But I hope one day Bolt decides to finish up this app for good! And just one recommendation: I think Tom and Charlie should have a more distinct look, like Charlie should be in his tiger form permanently instead of just when slicing a Pygmy. I know the two characters are already somewhat distinct with their facial expressions, but it would still be cool.

My father, husband and I all are absolutely disgusted with the barrage of weather apps. We had one we liked and the idiots discontinued it in favor of an \u2018upgraded\u2019 version they favored leaving all users in the cold. On the hunt we\u2019ve been and found nothing. This, our far favorite 2nd place...I tried the \u2018paid\u2019 to pro to at least see if that would allow for a better insight into the info we no longer had. No. It not only did not, but instead...now I have a paid for app that constantly, and I mean constantly crashes. You owe a refund as its utterly unusable. Either offer a product ready to launch or dont offer it until it is. Charging people for an \u2018upgraded\u2019 format that is far from it is bordering on fraud. Clearly you are aware the issues. Fix it or refund. There are only 2 choice as people are depending on Doppler for their lives and all ye weather apps claim to have it and are even now charging for some sort of \u2018better\u2019 access to it.

Get you\u2019re act together.</p>|I have used this app on several devices or the last few years.  It has always worked well and the developers have always improved the performance. I recently downloaded the app on a large iPad Pro.  The app works well but does not have the ability to find or track your location. This is not a huge deal but the omission detracts from the performance of the app.  I wrote a letter to the developer and received several instructions to resolve the situation but the person did not provide a useful solution and has since ignored my correspondence. My conclusion is the developers did not include this feature in version 5.3.0 for the iPad Pro.  I have this same version on iPhones and older iPads and the automatic location finder works well on them.  Very disappointed that you cut corners for the large iPad.  This seems to go along with other less than stellar reviews I have read in the App Store about your app. It\u2019s too bad that your attention to detail as well as customer support has diminished over time. I still have the app on my device for the earthquake trackers but do not use very much I have since loaded another app that has the automatic location finder and use that frequently.  Its too bad you don\u2019t listen to your customers and respond to their problems.</p>|Use it all the time to check for rain along travel route. App supplements what I get on local TV.  I can zero in on specific locations with it to check rainy or flooding conditions.  I highly recommend it.   For a time - earlier in 2016 - the location dot did not work right.   I could travel from home to Mobile, AL and the locator dot would track me.  However, lots of times when I got home the locator dot still showed me to be in Mobile.

When I heard a second game had been released, I was overjoyed and downloaded it immediately. I was NOT disappointed. I loved MV2 just as much as I loved the original, if not more because of the new additions, like Ro\u2019s daughter and the ability to draw your own sacred geometry shapes. The only thing this game lacks is content. I got through the entire game I a few hours. I feel like there needs to be more to the story \u2014 in MV1, Ida is on a quest for forgiveness. We get to follow her through that journey and watch her complete it, which gives a sense of satisfaction. We know /what/ she\u2019s doing, and /why/, which is what gives that game such a satisfactory end. But we don\u2019t know anything about what\u2019s going on in MV2. Who is Ro? Who is her daughter? Who are the ghosts? Why is she sending her daughter on a boat alone? Like I said, I love these games. The music, the complexity, the story, the visuals \u2014 all are fantastic. I can\u2019t wait to see what UsTwo has in store for us. Hoping for a third installment!!! Many thanks.</p>|I just need to say it a great game. You all put great effort into it. I need to say it again it\u2019s a great game, but (there is all ways a but) five dollars for a game with only ten level. Unless you count that level in the extras which feels like 6 levels. Also I know there is a second game, but five dollars for this game that\u2019s insane. Two dollars understandable but four dollars no way. I do know that I can buy eight more levels for two dollars which in total that is nineteen level for seven dollars. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t like this game it\u2019s a great game as I said. I can tell it looks like a hard game to make so its understandable why there is very little levels. If you are reading this review I would not mind you getting this game. Just don\u2019t be surprised that you finished this the game In one day like me. Also I don\u2019t have the second game so if the second one is longer then the first that would be great. So if I was you I would get the game if you like puzzle game.(Yes this is a puzzle game if you couldn\u2019t tell) It\u2019s a very fun game so enjoy if you do get it.</p>|First of all on of the the first reviews is like a one or two star review that says this game is short and easy. Maybe the first levels are easy but I can\u2019t call this short there\u2019s plenty of levels to take a few days and for an indie puzzle game that\u2019s a real achievement. I will change to five star if you explain the \u201c box\u201d level. Once you solve green it takes you back to blue and both doors are locked all other levels took like five minutes but I\u2019ve been stuck on this one for a week \ud83d\ude14. I will try the sequel and try this game on iPad to see if either of these options are better (am only assuming this game is easier on iPad because maybe a bigger screen will help). Is this a glitch? Or am I just doing something wrong? So confused \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f edit: I just realized that there is a a bird person that can do it for you I don\u2019t think it was there before.

Though I would still use it for that purpose, with my flashes, diffusers and such, the iPhone SE has a higher megapixel count, so using the iPhone is so easy, but it used to be too simple. I\u2019ve been using ProCamera for years now and it keeps getting better and better. Their settings keep getting more complex, but for good reason. Apple\u2019s own software has problems zooming live video, and the HDR is simply the best.I had to shoot to record location and depth of holes in the ground (long story), and with Apple you could only see the ground with a black hole, even with HDR, but with PC I got the ground and also the hole\u2019s depth and what was at the bottom.And that\u2019s just the beginning; saving options, RAW format, there\u2019s so much more. If you\u2019ve used pro equipment you\u2019ll be happy to have all these features. I know these apps can nickel someone to death, and try things and get rid of them regularly, and PC I use often, it\u2019s well worth the price (and I have NOT been paid to say so.I cannot use an iPhone to do the product work I used to (sometimes there is no substitute for high quality lighting and lenses, but for everything else, it\u2019s iPhone and PC. I usually import them using Adobe Lightroom or Bridge, and the results are awesome! Try it, you will not be disappointed!...</p>|Search no more my friends, you have hit the jackpot in camera apps!  I'm embarrassed to admit, since I am a photographer'l but I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on pathetic camera apps that nearly all of them fell short of a crappy one star review. Take it from someone that took a punch in the bank account.  Read the reviews here, these are not people paid to lie for pure entertainment purposes.  If I had done that I would of saved myself some serious cash and would of also saved myself from a lot of painful headaches from not getting the shot I wanted.  PRO CAMERA has done a complete overhaul on this app and although it was a Phenomenal app before it is now a spectacular photography app.  If you are into iPhone photography dump every other app you got and get this one and if you\u2019re a beginner then your photos are about to get a whole lot better.  Thank you to the developers and just a huge Kudos to everyone under the hood of PROCAMERA/Coclogics</p>|I've tried a number of camera apps and even thought I found the best with ProCam, but there's something about this UI that got me. Simple to use yet lots of fantastic features tucked away. I was sold with the the widget which opens the app and is ready to shoot amazingly fast.Editing tools are not as great as other apps, but I'd rather do editing on my computer for certain photos. RAW capability is awesome and the portrait mode is super fast and I love the ability to post-adjust the bokeh. Portrait mode has crashed the app a few times for me and I've reached out to support on that.I've been impressed with the customisation of modes and quite impressed with the LowLight feature for nighttime shots. Purchased LowLight+ with the noise reduction \u2013 amazing! Totally worth it. And the LUX feature is truly something. Close to getting the HDR feature. All in all this app is feature-rich, fast, easy to use, and makes my photos look professional.</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 83%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.7, 1.7K Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#18 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "43.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/paul-salameh/id575154657?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Think you have what it takes to adopt a POU?

I really LOVE this app its so addictive and fun the mini games are super fun love them and i just found out how to friend people and hangout with them!!  I just made my friend download it so she could play with me so yeah! And i also love that u can unlock things by either waiting till u reach that level or with 1999 coins.   And here\u2019s my question.  Why on some platforms (such as IOS/Apple,Android Tablets) it cost money  Because i have an iPad and it was free, the friend i was talking about has a Samsung 4 (I think) and my other friend has an iPhone 6 and ears cost 1.99?!  What sense?!  Now she cant play with me unless she pays witch i know I wouldent do i would not pay for an app that\u2019s free in other devices.

I remember when the car game where you just keep going forward came out (forgot what's it's called) a few years ago. And, last year, My Boo copied the exact same idea!Well that doesn't mean it's first, you may be thinking. And you're right. But if you look it up, pou came out august 5th, 2012, and my boo came out in 2015. So there. Do you're research.This game is really fun! I would totally recommend it. It's REALLY addictive though (that's not always a bad thing!)I used to play this game a lot but then I just... forgot about it. I was scrolling through my purchased apps and decided: \"hey? Why not?\"And it's still better than my boo.</p>|Pou is a game where you have a small creature, your Pou, and you dress them up and take care of them, Tamagotchi style. I love this game so so much! I got it a few years ago on another phone and I loved my Pou so much, but I switched phones and Pou didn't make the switch. I sort of forgot about her, what with the app costing money and all, until a few weeks ago when I checked the App Store to find it was once again free! I immediately downloaded it. And luckily, this app lets you sign in and save your Pou, so I had my Pou back! I had missed her so much. There are so many things to do in this game and it's an overall super fun, super cute time killer. Now go out there and get your Pou!</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 69%;", "one_star": "width: 10%;", "star": "4.2, 1.6K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#5 in Family"}, {"size": "1 GB", "three_star": "width: 6%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/image-line-software/id432850147?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Create and save complete multi-track music projects on your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch.

I\u2019m not a big lover of the video games to be honest but this game has something that really catch me in a very special way, later play the game to computer and now that are available like app on the App Store I decide gives him an opportunity. The game app is pretty great, have pretty cool graphics, easy to play and the characters are the same just that couple things changed or was modified. In Bully Scolarship Edition (Second Version of the game), you\u2019ve got 4 extra characters more and inclusive have extra clothes changes. Apart that later of the chapter 5 you still receiving missions that is something that here change a little bit, in this Anniversary Edition later of the Chapter 5 (The Graduation) you will still receiving missions yes but no with the same frequency, now will cost you a little bit more can find missions and starting to be a little worried keep playing. But the rest pretty nice game, immediately that see it don\u2019t think two times to bought it I really recommended the game I promise you that don\u2019t will regret, really worth it pay the $6.99 for the game...</p>|I first payed this game on the PS2 when I was 8 didn\u2019t understand it at all. I played in high school and fell in love with it. The mini games, the replayability the character development and the plot. Something that I didn\u2019t love about the GTA series is the unrelatable characters. I completely relate to Jimmy due to how I made friends in elementary and high school. I have the Scholarship Edition on PC but it\u2019s in repair and bully crashes a lot in Windows 10 also there\u2019s no achievements at all which is a burden in my opinion. I love the fact that there\u2019s an Anniversary Edition on if it was on PC,Xbox One,PS4 and Nintendo Switch. The have the PS2 version on PS4 but $15 is asking a lot when it cuts away a bunches of content and missions. The iOS port is excellent and needs to be a console and PC release. Also there needs to be a bully College Edition or a prequel of how he was sent to Bullworth. Rockstar listen up because I like this game a lot better than the GTA games including GTA V. This game has a cult following so what are y\u2019all waiting for? Please make a bunch of sequels or prequels to this game.</p>|First off, this game is amazing for a T-Rated game made by a company who has been known for famous franchises such as Max Payne and GTA, the game feels like a GTA game but it's the teen version. R* really outdid theirselves when they made this mobile version of Bully, but there has been numerous bugs like the game crashes on the mission \"The Rumble\", after the fight with Peanut and his boys, the confrontation with Johnny crashes when he knocks Jimmy on the ground and the police show, I always make sure to make Cloud Saves just in case something like this happens, but this really is an issue that bugs me with Rockstar's Mobile Games, I'm glad they have Cloud Saves but these bugs need to get fixed ASAP. I'm giving this 5 stars even though it probably should be given 4, but the game is beautiful and has wonderful gameplay and a great story about a teenage bully named Jimmy Hopkins who tries to fit in at a school called Bullworth Academy that's riddled with bullies, jocks, rich kids, slicks like greasers, and other kinds of troubles.</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "12+", "five_star": "width: 83%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.6, 2.7K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#7 in Adventure"}, {"size": "110.4 MB", "three_star": "width: 10%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/disney/id284888248?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Get the GAME OF THE YEAR award-winning puzzler!Help Swampy by guiding water to his broken shower.

I bought it a few years ago, played it a lot, and forgot about it for a couple of years. I just redownloaded it and I can't stop playing it. It's really satisfying to play. The games are challenging enough to keep it interesting, but never so challenging that you get frustrated. The graphics and sounds are amusing and nice to look at, and I'm kinda in love with that little alligator. Half the fun for me is just successfully completing a level so that he can get his shower.  He just looks and sounds so happy when he gets his shower, and that makes me happy. I know this is supposed to be a children's game, but I'm 45 and I freaking love it.</p>|It's one thing to have an ad after every level. BUT TWO ADS? Every time I watch the required amount of time to fast forward through the rest of the ad (which is typical for most apps) it then has a SECOND ad pop up.This game used to have so many bugs and close regularly for no reason. Glad they fixed that fatal flaw at least. But the second you guys fix that issue, you pull this stunt? I've never played a game with so many ads. Fix this ridiculous issue and I'll delete my review and give the game 5 stars. This game has the potential to be good, and even something I'd recommend to others... but given the constant double ads after EACH LEVEL, I will never recommend this game to anyone.</p>", "four_star": "width: 15%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 57%;", "one_star": "width: 11%;", "star": "4.0, 1K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#7 in Family"}, {"size": "268.1 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/toca-boca-ab/id419103351?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Experience the excitement of a busy medical center with Toca Life: Hospital!
