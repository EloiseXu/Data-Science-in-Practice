You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your mobile dreams have finally come true!Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. DISCLAIMERGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.KEY FEATURES* You can be a goat * Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat * MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it * In-game physics that bug out all the time * Seriously look at that goat's neck * You can be a goat</p>", "subtitle": "N/A", "title": "Goat Simulator", "similar": "  The Trail\n,  Chameleon Run\n,  Lifeline: Whiteout\n,  PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator\n,  Perchang\n,  Sonic CD Classic\n", "two_star": "width: 3%;", "price": "Infrequent/Mild Profanity or Crude Humor", "inapp_purchase": "N,/,A", "autor": "Coffee Stain Publishing", "reviews": "|Please fix this glitch: When I am playing the game randomly crashes. I have the newest version and use a iPad Pro. Also there is not much to do in the school map, at least nothing very exciting. In goatville you can blow up a train, play with a rag doll, obliterate Coffee Stains Studios, or jet pack off a crane. In the city (I forgot its name) you can fly on a firework, get yourself flung off a rollercoaster, beat up the ninja turtles in the sewers (lol) or blast a hotel cafe. What can you do in the school map? Well, catch book thieves, draw graffiti on the walls, and make a statue of your goat (TNT involved). Hmmm.... lacks the craziness of the other maps. So maybe add some more exciting stuff in the school. Also I have an idea for a map, an airport. You can blow up a plane (huge explosion, obliterates  most of the stuff near it) pull bizarre things out of suitcases (like a T-Rex) and more. Also a goat idea would be the Caffeine Goat that you get by drinking coffee. When you tap POW, the goat goes crazy. Maybe a Slither Goat, which is like a snake goat. Also, please make glass breakable, I think that would add much more fun to the game. Maybe you can add a friends system, so like if someone has a friend that plays Goat Sim, you can send them a friend request, and if the other player accepts, you can play together. Well that\u2019s all.

I love the fact that the planets show rotation. I'd love to see the developers consider updating in the future, the ability to tap into deeper space. Perhaps allowing us the chance to see the moons around planets, and any other space objects that are known in real time. One issue I find is the planets are askew/slightly off, causing me to adjust an approximate only to the L&amp;R, which still doesn't give a true correction (or onion skin) It'd also be nice to have more educational  factoids/info updated. This alone shouldn't deter you from getting this app, as its really the best one out there for those of us who love learning astronomy. I do love this app! I hope the programmers/developers consider our feedback &amp; wishes. Every time Its clear outside regardless of the weather, I open this app and learn something new!Four Years later and everything I asked for and more! Next Generation-I'd love to see a wayback option gps enabled where ever you are on the planet and the ability to go back in time to get the options to see the sky in the past (with known historical proven factual astronomical phenomena) that'd be a wonderful challenge for developers and experience for those of us who wish to see theSky as it was in roman times!</p>|I\u2019m writing this review just because of how amazing this app is. I\u2019m a kid who loves Astronomy, and takes it to long lengths. Just this Christmas, I got my first telescope! The Celestron 114 az Explorascope! I downloaded this app originally to see where my favorite star, Capella was located. Turns out, it had spot on location. I then got the full version, and have been using it on a weekly basis! This is an amazing app, and I look forward to using it for studying nebulas, planets, etc! I love this app mainly because I have been studying astronomy for about 5 years now, and have gone from knowing the basic 8 planets, to knowing the official names for several stars, galaxies, nebulae, and several other celestial bodies. This app is awesome for star gazing, planet watching, and exoplanet tracking! If you need a trustworthy, stable, easy to use app, download this for sure! My favorite part about this app is the mini lessons it gives you whenever you tap on a star, planet, nebula, star cluster, galaxy, you name it! I\u2019m never downloading any other astronomy app! Thanks a bunch!! :)</p>|I really fell in love with SkyView. It makes it so easy to learn about what I'm looking at in the night sky. There's one thing I think could make the app even better:Currently the only way to look at a specific object in the sky through the app is to point and orient your device so it is facing that object, like the camera. But sometimes I would like to search around the sky without waving my phone in crazy directions, like if I'm lying in bed and want to pan over to what's under the horizon. I think it would be great to add a feature that lets you pan across the sky without needing to move your phone, so it is not oriented by the gyroscope. The view can stay at a constant zoom level, but being able to learn the stars without having to always point in that direction would be tremendously more convenient. This could be an option that you can switch on or off to keep the integrity of the original application as well. Please consider. Thanks for a wonderful contribution to the world!</p>", "four_star": "width: 10%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 82%;", "one_star": "width: 5%;", "star": "4.6, 2K Ratings", "category": "Education", "sub_rank": "#4 in Education"}, {"size": "29.6 MB", "three_star": "width: 2%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/roto-sports-inc/id327110659?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Imagine you could get access to a cheat sheet that adjusts to fit your league settings AND allows you to mark off players during your draft.

Rating and the endless string of positive reviews. The rich set of valuable tools and features had me oozing with confidence heading into my draft. Unfortunately, this app won't help you when it matters. The most important and expensive league, which I spend months preparing for every year, and I bombed the draft because I couldn't access any of my custom cheatsheets, notes, draft order etc. All that work for nothing! I missed my first pick while trying to get this app working properly... I had to quickly Google a top 200 list and had to research player news and all that fun stuff in the middle of the draft! Meaning I was unable to follow the picks and had to forgo my usual draft stradegy. I believe the developer should make it very clear that all work and saved information will not be synced when signing into a different device. Thanks to this application, my draft was ruined and I hope others see this and heed my warning!</p>|I\u2019ve paid the $4.99 to get this fantasy football draft kit for two straight years now. Here\u2019s the good...The interface is fantastic as is the mock draft tool.  The quick and easy access to the updates on each and every player is also great.Here\u2019s the average...The player news updates/feeds are almost word for word what you can get from almost all free fantasy football sites.Here\u2019s the bad...I bought this app in very early August and they have barely changed any player projections since then.  The free sites I go to are constantly changing their player stat projections which in turn changes the player rankings.Here\u2019s the reality...If this was a free of 99cent app then I wouldn\u2019t bother posting here, but for $4.99 I think these \u201cexperts\u201d owe us more.  One example is that as Christian McCaffrey has moved up every draft board in the past 10 days but he has stayed static on this draft board.  That reeks of laziness.</p>|I\u2019m not saying his app will guarantee a championship but it will put you in the best spot to make it to the promise land! I do 1,000s yes 1,000s of mocks but the cool thing is you can do 5 in a few minutes. You can have the ran automatically or do them at your own pace. In 7 years in fantasy I have won over 6 in the 3 leagues I play. You need to be prepared and confident on draft day and this is the way to do it.

I have played the teeny titans series since the original teeny titans and I am in love with it. It is an amzing take on an rpg like dc game. My favorite part of the whole thing is collecting the figs! However, I do wish there where many more figs which might be asking alot but I have already collected all the figs twice including the legion of doom figs (which I love by the way) leaving me with not much variety left and I believe there is so much opportunity to utilize amazing DC characters and even some that are already in the game that I question why they aren\u2019t or dont have figs for them such as for heroes: Green Arrow,Hawkman, Red Tornado, Plastic Man, Doctor Fate, Zatanna, Firestorm and for villains: Captain Cold, B.R.A.I.N., Black Adam, Deadshot just to name a few. The only other thing that I hope is added in the future is more team bonuses meaningike justice league and titans bonuses before the match and i feel there are so many missed opportunities for ones like: a girls night out with (Raven, Starfire, Terra,  Jinx, Rose) or even additions to some like adding (Shazam,  Black Lightning, Booster Gold,  Blue Beetle, Batgirl) to the already existing justice league buff. I apologize for the long review but I love this game so much and I hope that some of these ideas are added in the future updates to the game but regardless it is a fantastic game and i can\u2019t wait for whatever is in store for the future!</p>|Before I get into it, i think the dev  team to add a button that lets you continue on to another titan after you beat the game, instead of having to restart it. (There should be a final battle where you use 15 figs (3 from each titan) in a giant tournament against (plot twist) THE CREATOR OF TEENY TITANS!!!!! Now I\u2019ll let you read. Also, please note that I still completed the game, and these were not that big. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still giving it 5 starsMany bugs, so I\u2019ll list some that I have been getting. First battle doesn\u2019t end unless you restart it. Random freezes, I got one when I was beating the bat cow. Couldn\u2019t beat it again for a long time. Certain pathways not letting me go there, even though I am allowed to. Martian Manhunters tournament bugging out on the Martian princess battle, some magnifying glasses doing nothing during day and night, and it didn\u2019t let me into the movie lot to find \u201csupes\u201d until after I had collected 20 dogs not 10, even though I pressed the give to mission button each time. (I made sure it wasn\u2019t other missions I had been giving the other 10 to). And, the item that you have to give 1.5K coins to the samaranian princess to get, (the healing lantern thingy) does nothing. No hearts come out and it doesn\u2019t give you any bonus hp.   But alas, it\u2019s a fairly new game and still amazing!!!</p>|We should have a reasonable number, I\u2019m thinking 3 to 6. And they should be so complicated that It will take us forever to finish them. They should be normal people with customizable features like hair, eye color, head shape, height and so on. And additional things like glasses hats and clothes. We should be able to choose what our stance is, what our dance is, what we look like when we get hurt, and our transitions when switching figures. We should also be able to choose what face we make when we do each of these things. We can choose a class and choose abilities that figures in that class have. And we can choose where we put them. I think some abilities should be available to every class. Basically things that don\u2019t do damage. To be fair, an attack is required. As for the actual figure, I we have poses to choose from, that would be cool. Sorry this is long. I think this is a pretty cool Idea, but I understand it would be complicated. I actually wouldn\u2019t expect you to even think about it. If you do decide to allow custom figs, these are my ideas.

With the new update I actually don\u2019t want to use it anymore. I paid for the app $6 a coupe of years ago so I wasn\u2019t using the free version. The change from horizontal (landscape) orientation to vertical (portrait) made it worse. It is difficult to see the snippets they are crammed. The editing portion of the screen changed - the ribbon where I pick the 1 sec sequences is not detailed and I can\u2019t see or hear how the 1 second snippet will sound/look like. When I pick something, try to play it, it replays the whole video, not that part I chose. The ribbon is not intuitive to navigate (as it used to be) and it is hard to pick the snippets. I can\u2019t pick custom dates to mash videos. It forces me to pick current year, everything. I used to show this app to everyone, I would pick a few custom dates and show them how it works and how great it is. I also can\u2019t replay snippets from prior years (i didn\u2019t save them). With this update actually I don\u2019t enjoy it and I am going to look for a different app with a similar functionality. There is a very aggressive push to the subscription service, but I already paid for the app and actually all the best features were taken away. Find a different app. It has such a great reviews becuse of the older version, but since March 2019 it is crap.</p>|I had posted this a while back \u201cI absolutely Love this app. I\u2019ve been using the free one for a year now and have been taking videos every day. However, it seems that a lot of the features of the free app are being taken away. We no longer can do 1.5 seconds for a clip and we can now only have one video where as before we could have two for each day. I understand that the free app will need to have limitations compared to the pro, however it seems like pretty soon there\u2019s not going to be anything left on the free app. And the jump to pro is quite big in regards to cost. I\u2019m really bummed that the app has changed so much in literally two days as I had access to all these features Thursday.\u201d Soon after this changes were made to the app and these features we accessible again without the pro and just he initial payment app. However, my phone just updated to the most recent iOS and with it, those few features went away, again I can only have one clip a day, no 1.5 second clips, and now I can\u2019t even create multiple montages.  Again, I understand that the free app will need to have limitations compared to the pro, however i\u2019m really bummed that they brought these features back and then removed them again as well as a few  more.</p>", "four_star": "width: 7%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 91%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.9, 26.5K Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#122 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "75.5 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/waplestuff/id562575890?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Calzy is a beautiful modern calculator for your everyday use.

Plus it is very simple to use... especially for me a partially colorblind person!!! Many many apps are designed (without consideration for the extremely large number of colorblind males) using the most difficult colors for the average colorblind person to see. The Calzy 3 Calculator is a blessing for me as a Color Blind Person.

All APP Developers should consider the ColorBlind people who want to use their apps. Thank you for this Convenient Easy to See Calculator!</p>|It lacks two necessary features that would enable it to be a truly productivity oriented app, as it should be. Here is what I mean:1) there is no separate all clear button!Fast inputs require this button to be  separately available otherwise it can impede on productivity. I am comparing this app to the stock calculator app as well as a physical calculator and the importance can easily be noticed.It is not to say that it is not there - it is combined with the regular delete function and the input can, too easily, be unregistered with a slight move of the finger whilst force pressing2) most importantly it loads too slowly to be used frequently as my main calculator (for business use). I use an iPhone X and the quick launch feature of Apple\u2019s own calculator bests the launch time of this app by miles. And in high pressure situations this app likely would not be preferred by most. In other instances, using this calculator is a breeze, as long as it is already opened and you are not in a time crunch. The user interface is pleasing to the eye and the added features are on point.Just add the two basics and this 4-Star app can easily be a 5-Star app</p>|I deleted my stock calculator on my iPhone after using this. I love it. You use your calculator a lot more than you think you do, whether it be calculating a tip at a restaurant or calculating how much you will get paid you use your calculator almost every day and I grew tired of the limitations from the stock calculator especially that if I messed up a calculation I would have to start all over. With this one everything is editable. They say people only leave reviews if the absolutely love something or they absolutely hate it. So the fact that I am leaving this review goes to show how much I love and use this calculator.

I liked it because of the Star Wars quotes that my hamster was saying. But I played some random ones and I started noticing what they were saying in them. They use really bad language for kids!  I don\u2019t want to specifically list them because I obviously don\u2019t like curse words, and because some kids read these reviews. I\u2019m really upset because I love this app so much! Please remove the phrases with curse words in them immediately! Or at least remove the curses from the phrase and replace them with a better word.

Well at roll-call even when I\u2019m in line the cops will still be mad that I\u2019m not in line even when I know I\u2019m 100% in line( this might be at other times during the day not just roll-call ). Then sometimes my game will crash randomly and I loose all my progress. So pretty please with a cherry on top add a save that starts you exactly where you left off( you don\u2019t have to just a suggestion ). This next one you might get a lot but I think I should still point it out just in case, so you know how mobile keys break after 4 uses and the others keys last at least 10 times, please make the mobile keys last as long as theirs. Okay this one doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this review but can you add creative mode to the mobile version please.

In jingle cells there isn't any flashlights anywhere.</p>|I love the Escapists and was debating whether to get it on PC or not, but then this came out and I knew I had to get it! For $4, I could see what the game was all about and have a better opinion on trying the DLC in the PC version (which I hope you add as in-app purchases later!). It was great, my brother and I both were playing it. Except, we were experiencing some launch bugs, which is to be expected. I encountered some text issues with the description of X item in the payphone. Also, sometimes the opening-desk sound kept looping for no apparent reason. My brother's game wouldn't let him escape other prisoners trying to beat him up while loading a save. He was just frozen in place while the black box around the screen faded away and the prisoners had time to come at him and kill him. He died every time he tried loading and was forced to stay in solitary without his items. But these bugs are minor, and I know you can fix them. Anyone that wants to get this game should definitely buy it, it is worth the money! Can't wait to see how it progresses in the future!</p>|When I first bought this game I played it for 10 hours straight. It has role playing elements with strategy and character affinity with item crafting... its a really fun game. The only complaint I have is crafting is supposed to be trial and error. I think this can be extremely frustrating, because you may craft something you think you need. or spend a few virtual days trying to save up for certain items when it turns out they were the wrong items or you didn\u2019t need them. They also make you pay (virtual in-game currency) for \u201ctips\u201d which basically are crafting recipes. Look up the crafting recipes online and keep it by your side while you play, is in my opinion the way to keep the game engaging and not frustrating. I\u2019ve played quite a few mobile games, and this is a gem. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes games to be challenging and engaging while still being a lot of fun. I don\u2019t recommend it to casuals, lol. you may get a little flustered if you\u2019re just used to candy crush ;)</p>", "four_star": "width: 14%;", "age_rating": "9+", "five_star": "width: 73%;", "one_star": "width: 6%;", "star": "4.5, 2.4K Ratings", "category": "Games", "sub_rank": "#20 in Strategy"}, {"size": "50.8 MB", "three_star": "width: 3%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/scott-cawthon/id777236428?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "This time, the terror has followed you home.In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows.

I admit, I shed a couple (a lot) of tears when I heard that it was over. These games were undoubtedly worth my time and my money from beginning to end.Concerning this app however, I was only slightly disappointed to find that I was not able to experience the lore minigames about the crying child, like the ones in this exact game on the PC. Hopefully someday you'll put that in.Another thing was, when I ran back and forth between doors during gameplay, I kept noticing a series of footsteps that sounded sort of like mine but a little faster and they would travel from left to right and vice versa. They kinda mess with my head when I'm trying to concentrate on all other tasks at hand. I really don't know what they are; if they're a bug or if they belong to Foxy or some other entity. But hopefully, if they ARE a bug, then it will be fixed in the future. If not, I'll just have to figure out about it on my own.Other than these two minor problems, the game was top notch and creepy as heck, just how I love your games. I would easily recommend this game to anyone who loves a good scare. :) keep at it Scott! You're a great man.</p>|Ok, first of all let me just say that this game is AMAZING and NOBODY should be complaining otherwise - Scott did an amazing job in doing a port version of this game. Does it have bugs? Yes - but let's be honest, what game dosnt? Nobody should be complaining about \"lag\" because it's not lag. Creating a game as big as this with this many animations is more work than it seems - and our small devices aren't exactly super computers so of course the fps will be a bit slow. I would recommend fixing the glitch where you can here your footsteps repeatedly when u walk to the closet or one of the doors - along with the breathing audio. A audio boost wouldn't hurt \ud83d\ude1c But what I'm trying to get at, is that people should stop complaining. Yes their are bugs, but if you were making a game as big as this, I'd like to see YOU make a game 100% perfect with 0 bugs. Scott, I love your work - I hope that one day you can reveal the truth to the games lore such as: who is the purple guy, what is the timeline, and how does everything fit together? Thank your for your time to read this, and I'm giving this game five stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fwhat it rightfully deserves \ud83d\ude04</p>|I remember when the first game came out, I was so scared of it. Then came the next one and I remember hyping it up so much, and it became my favorite game of the 4. When the third game came out, I was like \"How many games will this guy make?\" Then a few weeks later, a teaser came out of nightmare Freddy, and I was so hyped about this fourth game. I bought it for my PC as soon as it came out. I played the first night at it was probably the best game ever. The jumpscares are super scary, the animations and ambient noises are great, and the story ties up so many loose ends. There are still some things we need to know, like who is the purple man? Anyway, I checked the App Store every day until it came out and it was 11pm when I saw it, so even though it is scary, I played the first night and beat it. The quality isn't too good, and the game is sorta laggy, but I still give it five stars for its great story. Good job on the final FNaF, and I can't wait till Halloween for that special thing that's happening. I'm guessing either the movie or another horror series! That would be awesome Scott!

I\u2019ve been playing Persona 5 remotely with it (over the internet, not LAN), and it\u2019s been working really well. Now, there are occasional frame rate hiccups and latency issues, and the onscreen controls are only serviceable at best, but that\u2019s totally fine for a slower paced game like Persona. If you expect to play fast paced games remotely where tight controls and fast reaction times are important, you\u2019re going to have a bad time. It might work OK over LAN, but it\u2019s still not going to be great. But for certain slower games, it works nearly perfectly.A few details about my setup: I was not able to get the automatic remote setup working with my router configuration. I had to look at R-Play\u2019s help docs for opening the right router ports to get everything working, but if you\u2019re reasonably capable at futzing with router settings, you shouldn\u2019t have any issues. My PS4 is connected to my router with an ethernet cable, and my home internet speeds are 60Mbps down and 6Mbps up.</p>|Alright, so back in June my original PS Vita decided that it wasn't meant for this world. The screen broke and so ended my remote play sessions. So looking for alternatives to replacing my PS Vita I did a search for apps capable of making my phone respond like a Vita in remote play. All I see are four and five star reviews, and here I'm thinking I hit the jackpot. Reading up on all the ways this app integrates into your phone and connects to your Playstation 4, this is sure to be a rock solid investment for $12 plus tax. Wrong, wrong, I couldn't be more wrong. This app is clumsy at best, and certainly isn't responsive to commands. Only half of the available game library even appears on my phone screen. Then the on screen touch buttons don't work simultaneously. You can't for example input the command for a quarter circle motion forward. The touch command doesn't recognize simultaneous response. I was very disappointed. I tried this multiple times and tried various games to no success. I award this app the appropriate 1 out of 5 stars, and it receives only one star in this review, because it doesn't manage to boot up and sync with your Playstation console, but that's about all it does. Biggest waste of $12, just put it towards a replacement Vita pre-owned at GameStop, just like I did tonight. \u270c\ud83c\udffb</p>|This is a great app that works very very well! There is only a little minor lag if you leave the app running for multiple hours. The app even allows you to customize the on screen controls to whatever size you need them and where you want them! The graphics are even the same high quality on your iOS device as on you PS4! Also another GREAT thing is that you can use your DualShock 4 controller with this app as well as long as you have a second PSN account and follow the apps instructions! My only complaints are, first that the on screen controls are not that good, and second that the mifi controllers are pretty expensive and those are the only ones compatible with this app, and finally to be able to play you PS4 as a Nintendo switch away from home, you need to change some of your router settings and PS4 network settings, which for me a 13 year old is kind of crazy because it takes a lot of knowledge that most 13 year olds don\u2019t have!</p>", "four_star": "width: 8%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 76%;", "one_star": "width: 10%;", "star": "4.4, 4.4K Ratings", "category": "Entertainment", "sub_rank": "#8 in Entertainment"}, {"size": "3.1 GB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mlb/id281969992?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "It\u2019s a whole new ballgame with R.B.I.

The biggest thing to this point is that there is no learning curve for new players, you just keep logging on and getting rocked by AI opponents that know how to use the game controls effectively. Presumably this continues until the player learns how to use the controls, which would be fine for a free game, but to have paid $2 to be frustrated every time I play is quite disappointing. Casual gamers (players who don\u2019t have or won\u2019t commit the time to learn this game as effectively as the masterful AI) probably won\u2019t have much fun with this game.As for the gameplay, there is zero feedback or timing meters for the player during batting, which could be problematic since batting is entirely reliant on timing. I don\u2019t expect to hit a home run every at bat, but I do think there should be some sort of feedback to inform the player on their timing so they can make adjustments. For example: I know I\u2019m swinging early, but how early am I swinging so I can adjust appropriately? Pitching controls are just clumsy and moderately useless as the AI just gets the clutch hit every time anyway.Yes, it could be that I\u2019m just not good at this game. But so far I have little motivation to get better.</p>|EDIT: A couple small bugs/issues caused me to put the game down. For one, the game gives some of my players in franchise modes imaginary stats. Played about 6 games, hadn\u2019t recorded a hit with Gleyber Torres, but suddenly he had a home run in his stats? Not a huge deal but extrapolate that out over a season/franchise &amp; who knows what numbers are real. I also am finding the computer putting up 25 hits on me per game, on medium. I\u2019m fine with a game being difficult but I mean has any team ever even gotten that many hits? Could be a bit more realistic.. just frustrating when the rays string together 10+ singles in a row off a good pitcher. I downloaded the game on its release date, &amp; it was very buggy. Impossible to play, so I stopped. I\u2019ve seen them push the rough a few updates in the meantime &amp; decided to jump back in. Glad I did because the game is great! Haven\u2019t experienced any of the previous bugs, just a solid baseball game. The best baseball experience in the App Store for sure. Glad to see it in the top 12 on paid apps. Wish it had multiplayer or home run derby, like the console version, but maybe in a future update!</p>|I like the changes this year as some of the hang ups resolved themselves. Liked that roster finally over write the lineup and let you use them. I have found that my players won\u2019t steal when I press the man to steal. There is still no pickoff. The substitutions were a problem I could not get them to substitute early in the year as there was no good tutorial on how to make them so between what must have been a fix it has resolved itself. Injures would not resolve and return to active roster even though it said originally it was for 10 games. But once again I have lost a season of play. It happened at the game that should have on the schedule for 5/28. My franchise team is Atlanta Brave so I\u2019m playing the Mets and on e lat out in the 9th the game froze. I have killed the app and opened it back up and continued the game 3 times recorded the last out and it froze again on the last out in the 9th also replayed the game and yes it froze on the last out in the 9th. I deleted the app and reloaded and lost the whole season. Would like a refund this continues to be a problem on a regular basis every year.

So I know that the developers have already made crash cars wick is kind of the theme I am suggesting. But with a twist! Ok so keep the the same art style of earn to die make more weapons similar to the ones currently available and make more vehicles maybe 10 more? And make it where it\u2019s a large arena with 20 players or so and you have to destroy every car. But when a persons car is destroyed they can go on foot. Also make them be able to find another vehicle and weapons and maybe traps? I know this is a lot to ask but it seems like a good idea to me and please let me know what you think by responding</p>|I like this game, but there are some things that frustrate me about it. First, the vehicles feel way underpowered, even when you're fully decked out. In the original, this wasn't a problem, since you could just get a new car if you had earned enough. However, in this sequel, you're stuck with the car that's available for that level and that's it. This creates a situation where every new level feels like the first level, because you're starting with a fresh car. The other thing that irks me is the fact that you can buy money. Other than that, the game is fine.</p>|This game gets your mind off things when you need to just chill out and enjoy a little free time.  Just want to recommend this to anybody that is looking for a great game to play.  Many people come have much free time and like to enjoy their free time.

I purchased at least 5 or 6 other editing apps, and hated them all! Most of the apps were nothing more than the iPhone's editor with a few Instagram-like filters; essentially 3 or 4 layers of semi transparent colors and more or less exposure and saturation (that can't really be tweaked). If you like tacky, poor designed images, than sure, buy almost any other app.Enlight has so many effects, photo editing options, and filters (that actually look stunning and are also extremely editable themselves), that you can turn a poorly captured photo and make it look great! Other apps are so generic and basic that it turns great looking, clear images and turns them into a Snapchat filter gone wrong. I love Enlight so much that I stopped editing my personal social media posts with Photoshop and Lightroom and only use Enlight now - much faster, easier to edit on the fly, and produces images that are just as clean and beautiful as ones edited in Adobe Ps or Lr. One of my must have, nonnegotiable iOS apps!!!</p>|The app is very very nice. The editor is everything you would want, from layering to coloring, adding and subtracting, cropping rotating. One of the great things about it is that when you save your edit to your device it does not ruin the quality of the photo at all, and does not force a water mark either. I have tried some of the other editors by this developer but unfortunately they have added a lot of different things to pay for. I\u2019ll stick with the free stuff for now. I know the app is 5 dollars but that\u2019s it and it\u2019s well worth the price. One problem I have is that they have not yet added any of their programs to the Mac laptops and computers yet, could really be a big help.</p>", "four_star": "width: 9%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 88%;", "one_star": "width: 1%;", "star": "4.8, 45.8K Ratings", "category": "Photo & Video", "sub_rank": "#8 in Photo & Video"}, {"size": "47.7 MB", "three_star": "width: 5%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/scott-cawthon/id777236428?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "NOTE: This game requires at least 512 megs of RAM!

This animatronic, Springtrap, was never once mentioned before, so why should we like the game? Well, because Springtrap HAS been mentioned! In the second game phone guy clearly says: \"someone used one of the spare suits\" \"a yellow one\". Of course this is the night where Golden Freddy is the most active, but that's not the suit phone guy was talking about. Many people say that phone guy was talking about the spare Springtrap suit. Anyway ENOUGH ABOUT THEORIES!!! I love this game. I beat it. It was really hard and exiting! It's an odd spin to the game, and it's a little harder to find and play the hidden games on the mobile device, but I still love this!!! This game is horrifying! Every hallucinating jumpscare gets me, especially foxy! I always redo the ventilation, but somehow they're right there! I'm not complaining! I love it!!

This makes the game more fun and more challenging \ud83d\ude09It's worth it's price!!!</p>|Five Nights at Freddy's is undoubtedly one of the best horror games to ever hit the App Store. Unbelievable graphics, a great storyline and an amazing experience all combined into one game. It deserves every single fan it was getting. All the publicity it got was for a reason, because it was such a fantastic game. Obviously, Scott felt he had an obligation to make a second game, which was an awesome game as well. More animatronics, and the Purple Man story both made it something to remember. Millions of fans were awed by the series and wanted it to have an epic conclusion. The end of a trilogy, what everyone will remember when they look back on Five Nights at Freddy's years from now. Sadly, although this game shares incredible graphics and experience just like its predecessors, I feel like it was sort of a disappointment. Every game flowed together so perfectly like pieces of a puzzle. That's what set these games apart from the others. But this was an attempt to go away from that, to make the last Freddy's game different than the previous ones. And in my opinion, it failed. I've played Five Nights at Freddy's since the beginning. But I was so uninterested in the story of this one, I quit on Night 3. Because Scott tried to go outside what made Five Nights at Freddy's what it is. And although it was a good attempt, he didn't succeed.</p>|I love 5 nights at Freddy's and I usually beat them all with flying colors but this one is just hard. It was easy on night 1 and 2 and I barely made it past night 3. Night 4 on the other hand, is impossible. I have been stuck on night 4 for 2 weeks now. The latest I've gotten to is 2 A.M.. I normally get killed at 12 or 1. The puppet came into my office literally 5 seconds after I started the game and about 3 seconds after he comes in, I get killed. I also got jumpscared by foxy, chica, Freddy, and then springtrap all within like 10 seconds and it was only 12 a.m.. I also had just started the game and springtrap was in cam 9 and then disappeared and not even 2 seconds later I get jumpscared when he was all the way at the other end of the building and I had just started the game and it didn't even play that creepy noise to warn me. These games are usually fun and easy to me but this one I'm more frustrated than amused. It's very hard and I don't know if all the jumpscares and the difficulty of it is normal but it's practically impossible. I've literally been trying to get past night 4 for 2 weeks now and can't even make it past 2 a.m. Pretty much impossible.

If you are looking for a program to help get you there, then the \u201cCouch to 5K\u201d running plan by CoolRunning is probably your best bet if you haven\u2019t done an ounce of athletic activity for a number of years.\"\u2014Droid Life, April 2012FAQ\u2022 Once you purchase the app, it is yours to keep.

It worked so well, and I was even able to finish it and run my first 5K! Well through the year, I started slacking and wanted to get back into running because I love doing it. I knew right where to go to help me start training. This Couch to 5K app! Downloading it and opening up and seeing the beautiful new redesign was a nice surprise, and I was so excited to run. I went to my normal spots where I used to run where I never had an issue tracking my speed, distance, or placement on a map. After my run, I went to check how I did, and I couldn\u2019t see any info. It said I ran/walked a distance of 0.07 miles, when I actually did about 1.75 miles, and it had no information of my speed. It didn\u2019t start tracking me until I was in my cool down. I\u2019ve tried turning my location services on and off, clearing my workout history, going to a different place I used to run, starting a new account, and nothing!! I  used to have no problem with it tracking me, and now I don\u2019t really understand what the issue is.</p>|I've run several 5k and even a 10k prior to the app. I was \"out of the game\" for a while and decided to use this app to get back into it. Building up and focusing on time spent running rather than distance really helped me learn to better pace myself. I like that none of the runs are incredibly long either, the longest toward the end is around 40 mins including warm up/ cool down.  I recommend to friends often. However, I'm not giving 5 stars because I've encountered SO many glitches. Several times the app has shut down on me without warning, and when it does that none of the run is recorded (this usually happens to me toward the end of the run). The distance and time recorded in the app also include warm up and cool down, which I hate. I want to know my pace and time spent during the actual workout only. For those two reasons, I always keep a second running app recording on my phone with running to give me better data and reliability.</p>|I have been using this app on my IPhone 5 for a couple of years with no problems. Simple, easy to use and accurate.  I just upgraded to iOS 11 and have had nothing but problems since then. I\u2019ve gone on 2 runs and 10 minutes in the timer gets wonky. The seconds get tripped up, move slowly or the timer stops altogether. Yesterday I was in the cool down and the timer stopped. Then the app closed and all my data for that run was lost. Super frustrating. I tried resetting the app and also deleted and reloaded it, to no avail. I even ran the timer against a stopwatch for accuracy and the same problem occurred. I love this app and want to continue to use it, but will have to look elsewhere if they can\u2019t fix this bug. I emailed them today so we\u2019ll see what happens. Like other reviewers, I also have experienced the same issue with the music volume dropping way down after the first voice prompt. Not nearly as big of an issue as inaccurate / buggy timing, but a nuisance just the same. I hope they can fix these issues.</p>", "four_star": "width: 15%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 72%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.5, 1.7K Ratings", "category": "Health & Fitness", "sub_rank": "#4 in Health & Fitness"}, {"size": "267.2 MB", "three_star": "width: 4%;", "autor_URL": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/toca-boca-ab/id419103351?mt=8", "table_title": "free-apps", "description": "Welcome to Toca Life: City, a metropolis filled with everyday fun!

Parents or whoever is buying this I\u2019d recommended reading. So, this is game Toca City. It\u2019s a series of Toca life games. I would say start of with this game. If your kid is 2-4, Try out Toca town first it\u2019s easier. This game is full of fun action and actives that you can do or play with. You can make own person, make a family, or best of all make a story! There is a play where your kids have their people make a play, a small house where they can live, oh yeah we all the balcony where you can throw your stuff off of. There is a hair dresser, and tailor a mall with pets. It\u2019s really amazing. So I hoped this helped to see if you want the game or not, it\u2019s truly cute and wonderful it really spark imagination. :DMy part. Ideas. This are really not for anybody but the devs and others who want to share them. I LOVE THE NEWS ABOUT TOCA WORLD! I have been dying to have this. Not just connect the worlds in this update can we have new homes and some disabled people? I\u2019d like a huge home to added for my bed families, and maybe add some new Toca people. I really would like so more cute houses. Now, back to my ideas. I would say after Toca world. Toca neighborhood! There would be many houses apartments, and a zoo or you could just add these to the Toca world. I\u2019m sure no dev\u2019s red this but atleast I got to work on my typing skills.</p>", "four_star": "width: 11%;", "age_rating": "4+", "five_star": "width: 79%;", "one_star": "width: 4%;", "star": "4.6, 3.5K Ratings", "category": "Education", "sub_rank": "#40 in Education"}
