But I personally also like to slightly adjust them. For example, I usually turn down the brightness a bit to make text on the home-/lockscreen better readable, so that feature is in the app. Other adjustments include contrast, blackpoint, and saturation.\n\nThe hole thing with these devices intrigues me as well. So I wanted to know if I could determine in code where they were, and auto-realign/scale images made for one model to another. While the cameras are close to each-other, they don't overlap exactly, and this discrepancy shows when using an image made for one device on another (out of sync hole). Works pretty well on S10/S10E, leaves something to be desired on the S10+.\nThe algorithm is generic so support for more devices should be easy to add. (This idea is really what led me to build this, might as well release it now I've satisfied my curiosity).\n\nAs an example of the above, the height of the cutout on the S10+ is a little bit less than that of the S10. When using an S10+ image on the S10, you still get a curve of missing pixels below the cutout. This realign/scale feature slightly zooms and offsets the image, so the holes align.\n\nFeatures\n\n\n- Browse holey images\n\n- Set homescreen / lockscreen / both wallpapers\n\n- Image adjustments: brightness, contrast, blackpoint, saturation\n\n- Image scaling: align the image's hole to your current device\n\n- Sorting by new or popular\n\n- Device filtering\n\n- Category filtering\n\n- Download wallpapers\n\nNotes\n\n\nThe scraper takes all images from the sub that have a dedicated post that directly links to it. Only reddit and imgur links are currently supported. Minimum width is 640 pixels, and the aspect ratio has to be just right.\n\nI might add scraping the comments at some point, but this is not currently done.\n\nThe category a wallpaper ends up in is decided by the flair of the post.\n\nA lot of recent images include the phone's frame. While those work fine on the exact device they were meant for, they do not rescale well to other devices. (And IMHO it doesn't look good, but that's just my opinion you are free to completely ignore).\n\nFreedom!\n\n\nThis app is free, without in-app purchases, without ads, without tracking (other than popularity of wallpapers), but *with* GPLv3 sauce. The backend has sauce too!\n\nFeedback\n\n\nEither leave a review on Play that I probably won't read, comment in the Reddit thread, or submit to the GitHub issue tracker\n\nMotion effect\n\n\nHoley wallpapers don't play nice with the motion effect. The app does not have sufficient rights to adjust this setting. To disable it, in your home screen, first apply one of Samsung's wallpapers, which allows you to deselect Motion effect. Then go back to using Hidey Hole.\n\nIt can be done through adb shell with settings put system wallpaper_tilt_status 0.", "ratings_1": "1%", "ratings_2": "1%", "ratings_3": "1%", "ratings_4": "11%", "ratings_5": "100%", "size": "2.4M", "installs": "10,000", "age": "PEGI 3", "table_title": "Top New Apps", "title": "41.

Your search for fortune will see you pitch blade and spell book against a host of enemies including the undead, demons, and lizardmen and many other creatures. In a battle that is part game-book and part tactical RPG, you will build a powerful band of warriors and wizards and tilt the balance of power in the northern kingdoms.\n\nTake part in deep, turn-based combat. Combat is realistic and incorporates details such as weapon range, damage effects, and counter attacks without slowing down gameplay. Players will also have to use cover and line of sight effectively to be successful.\n\nBuild a party from among 16 different classes. Choose a party of six heroes that range from scholarly wizards to hardened warriors. Using each character type to their fullest is vital to securing victory as most excel in only certain tasks. Wizards have massively destructive magic but will fall quickly to a simple spear thrust while great warriors can hold off a horde if properly supported.\n\nA unique morale system adds an entirely new tactical layer to the combat. Warriors will fight far better if they believe the tide of battle is on their side and will begin to panic if they believe otherwise. Watching a friend fall or an enemy leader slain drastically affects morale. Arrows and spells, even when they miss, will affect the courage of both friends and foes in their area of effect. Finally, the bloodlust mechanic means certain warriors will find new sources of energy for each foe they slay.\n\nCollect hundreds of powerful magic items to equip your party. Each character can equip up to nine items from swords, shields, cloaks, rings to helmets. Each item can range from a common item that grants only a small benefit to legendary items that can both boost stats and grant entirely new powers to its bearer. Fighters can equip magical rings that can allow them to conjure fireballs or summon undead guardians, for example. The magic item system allows you to customize your party even further and develop entirely new tactics and battle plans.\n\nEnjoy over 40 hours of gameplay in the campaign. Your journey will see you lead your party across snow-covered wilderness, through dark caverns, ancient ruins and the bloody streets of great cities. Battles can be replayed at various difficulties and no level cap provides no end of enjoyment for the die-hard player.\n\nDelve into a gritty, realistic world that blends dark age history and culture with fantasy races and monsters. The northern kingdoms of Tarren are places where men fight in shield walls with spear, axe and sword against elves, dwarfs, goblins and even dragons.

FilmLab includes modes for color negative, black and white negative, and color positive. It also provides tools for rotating and flipping the image, and adjusting exposure and color balance. FilmLab's negative-to-positive conversion is much more than a simple inversion. It uses custom algorithms to emulate the chemical processes used in darkrooms, and produce accurate colors and tones.\n\nOnce you're happy with your proof sheet or image, you can save it to your Gallery, and from there share on social media or do further editing using any photo editing app you have installed.\n\nEach film image is unique and special. That piece of film was in a specific place at a specific moment in time, and it captured the light as a permanent image using nothing but science and chemistry.

Your search for fortune will see you pitch blade and spell book against a host of enemies including the undead, demons, and lizardmen and many other creatures. In a battle that is part game-book and part tactical RPG, you will build a powerful band of warriors and wizards and tilt the balance of power in the northern kingdoms.\n\nTake part in deep, turn-based combat. Combat is realistic and incorporates details such as weapon range, damage effects, and counter attacks without slowing down gameplay. Players will also have to use cover and line of sight effectively to be successful.\n\nBuild a party from among 16 different classes. Choose a party of six heroes that range from scholarly wizards to hardened warriors. Using each character type to their fullest is vital to securing victory as most excel in only certain tasks. Wizards have massively destructive magic but will fall quickly to a simple spear thrust while great warriors can hold off a horde if properly supported.\n\nA unique morale system adds an entirely new tactical layer to the combat. Warriors will fight far better if they believe the tide of battle is on their side and will begin to panic if they believe otherwise. Watching a friend fall or an enemy leader slain drastically affects morale. Arrows and spells, even when they miss, will affect the courage of both friends and foes in their area of effect. Finally, the bloodlust mechanic means certain warriors will find new sources of energy for each foe they slay.\n\nCollect hundreds of powerful magic items to equip your party. Each character can equip up to nine items from swords, shields, cloaks, rings to helmets. Each item can range from a common item that grants only a small benefit to legendary items that can both boost stats and grant entirely new powers to its bearer. Fighters can equip magical rings that can allow them to conjure fireballs or summon undead guardians, for example. The magic item system allows you to customize your party even further and develop entirely new tactics and battle plans.\n\nEnjoy over 40 hours of gameplay in the campaign. Your journey will see you lead your party across snow-covered wilderness, through dark caverns, ancient ruins and the bloody streets of great cities. Battles can be replayed at various difficulties and no level cap provides no end of enjoyment for the die-hard player.\n\nDelve into a gritty, realistic world that blends dark age history and culture with fantasy races and monsters. The northern kingdoms of Tarren are places where men fight in shield walls with spear, axe and sword against elves, dwarfs, goblins and even dragons. Wizards and monsters are powerful but can still be defeated with sound tactics, armour and courage.", "ratings_1": "0%", "ratings_2": "40%", "ratings_3": "20%", "ratings_4": "0%", "ratings_5": "100%", "size": "March 18, 2019", "installs": "41", "age": "PEGI 16", "table_title": "Top Selling New Games", "title": "24.

Root Defense\n- If you clear the 1st phase of poker defense or fortification defense, you will be fined.\n- You can create an enemy movement route at the beginning of the game.\n- The enemy's movement route should not be blocked and must reach the end point.\n- When the enemy reaches the end point, one Life is reduced. (The boss is defeated immediately)\nCreate a random unit at -20 won.\n- Destroy the enemy to acquire money and create more units to combine.\n- If there are two units in the same unit, the Combination button is activated.\n- Unlike other defenses, there is no rating enhancement, and each unit is upgraded.\n- Combine units to maintain a higher upgrade.\nIt consists of -100 waves.\n\n\n[BGM]\n\n\u25ba Music Credit: OurMusicBox (Jay Man)\nTrack Name: \"Crack Of Dawn\"\nMusic By: Jay Man @ https://ourmusicbox.com/\nOfficial \"OurMusicBox\" YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/c/ourmusicbox\nLicense for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) https: //creativecommons.org/licenses/ ...\nMusic promoted by NCM https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ\n\n\u25ba Music Credit: OurMusicBox (Jay Man)\nTrack Name: \"Eye For An Eye\"\nMusic By: Jay Man @ https://ourmusicbox.com/\nOfficial \"OurMusicBox\" YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/c/ourmusicbox\nLicense for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) https: //creativecommons.org/licenses/ ...\nMusic promoted by NCM https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ\n\n\u25ba Music Credit: SUNDANCE\nTrack Name: \"Persephone - Retro Funky (SUNDANCE remix)\"\nMusic By: SUNDANCE @ https://soundcloud.com/sundancemusic\nThe SUNDANCE Official Website is HERE - http://lefthandmusic.fr/\nFollow SUNDANCE on BandCamp: https://sundancemusic.bandcamp.com/\nLicense for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) https: //creativecommons.org/licenses/ ...\nMusic promoted by NCM https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ\n\nSong: No Winners\nArtist: Ross Bugden\nArtist's channel: https: //www.youtube.com/channel/UCQKG ...", "ratings_1": "N/A", "ratings_2": "N/A", "ratings_3": "N/A", "ratings_4": "N/A", "size": "March 24, 2019", "installs": "54", "age": "PEGI 3", "table_title": "Top Selling New Games", "title": "67.  \ub3c4\ubc15 \ub514\ud39c\uc2a4", "imgURL": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2HIoDM5ybUND95EQYbJxEF1TuiPIfmV5RJ3qfsgQHomVvpslxEe-RZNeKZtHUlxAinc=w340", "description": "You can enjoy various defenses with one game!

Scattered worlds were claimed on the fringe of the galaxy. Each pocket of survivors held on to an isolated set of worlds while trying to rebuild under the great law of Shalun. Three centuries later, technology has brought them back together again.

The hyperwarp reestablished the transportation of cargo, goods, and technologies between the quadrants \u2013 but it has also brought great strife. Political rivalries have been rekindled, blood has been shed in age-old feuds, and the fires of war have been stoked.

In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires.

This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you \u201cspend\u201d each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money. \n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 20 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\n\nThe Secret to Money by Rhonda Byrne was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself: \n\n\"When I discovered The Secret back in 2004, the first big subject that I used The Secret for was money. \n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn\u2019t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief \u2013 a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. Considering the decades I had believed in a lack of money, it didn\u2019t take too long for me to see the circumstances of money begin to change in my life. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"I know that whatever I can do anyone can do \u2013 and that\u2019s why we created The Secret to Money App. The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"", "ratings_1": "0%", "ratings_2": "0%", "ratings_3": "2%", "ratings_4": "13%", "ratings_5": "100%", "size": "February 1, 2019", "installs": "29", "age": "PEGI 3", "table_title": "Top Selling Apps", "title": "83.
